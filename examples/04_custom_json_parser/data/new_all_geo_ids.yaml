  title: Cigarette Smoking Reduces DNA Methylation Levels at Multiple Genomic Loci
    but the Effect is Partially Reversible upon Cessation
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation is an epigenetic event whose pattern is altered frequently
    in a wide variety of human diseases. Smoking affects DNA methylation possibly
    leading to abnormal expression of a broad spectrum of genes which in turn may
    result to the various side effects and diseases associated with smoking. The long
    term effects of smoking have been widely studied but the mechanism(s) by which
    those effects may be reversible by smoking cessation are not clearly understood.
    Here, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in peripheral-blood DNA
    in 464 individuals who were current, former and never-smokers. We identified 15
    distinct loci (10 of which were novel) where DNA methylation was reduced in smokers
    and was reversed (but did not reach non-smoking levels) upon smoking cessation
    within 12 weeks. Although the functional impact of this reversal of DNA methylation
    is still not understood, this study illustrates the potential of epigenomics to
    provide insights into mechanisms of environmental and lifestyle exposures, and
    to suggest new avenues for clinical intervention

  title: The CURELUNG Project from the Epigenetics Side (Patients dataset)
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a very common solid tumor where only
    small advances in the reduction of relapse-free survival and overall survival
    have been accomplished. The issue is particularly critical for stage I patients
    where there are not available biomarkers, in the absence of detectable nodal or
    other metastatic involvement, that might indicate which high-risk patients should
    receive the beneficially proved adjuvant chemotherapy. We aimed to find DNA methylation
    markers with prognostic value that could be helpful in this regard and complement
    the conventional staging. A DNA methylation microarray that analyzes 450,000 CpG
    sites in the human genome was used to study primary tumoral DNA obtained from
    a multicenter cohort of 490 patients with NSCLC, corresponding to 339 adenocarcinomas,
    133 squamous carcinomas and 18 large cell carcinomas, in addition to 25 normal
    lung epithelium samples. The obtained prognostic DNA methylation markers were
    validated by the development of a single methylation-pyrosequencing assay in an
    independent cohort of 143 patients with stage I NSCLC. The unsupervised clustering
    of the studied primary NSCLC distinguished two branches with distinct clinical
    outcomes. Those CpG sites that were the best predictors of recurrence in stage
    I NSCLC patients were further confirmed in the described independent cohort. Both
    the global DNA methylation classifier and the highly-ranked aberrantly methylated
    single genes improved prognostic accuracy beyond standard stagings.

  title: An Epigenetic Signature in Peripheral Blood Associated with Neurodegenerative
    Tauopathy and the Risk-Associated Haplotype on 17q21.31
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
    are two neurodegenerative diseases linked, at the pathologic and genetic level,
    to the macrutubule associated protein tau. We identified and replicated a dose-dependent
    effect of the risk-associated H1 haplotype on methylation levels within the region
    in independent datasets in blood and brain. These data reveal that the H1 haplotype
    increases risk for tauopathy via differential methylation, indicating a mediating
    role for methylation in dementia pathophysiology.

  title: Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes
    at proximal promoters and enhancers
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in
    genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
    most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent
    evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important
    role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated
    SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina
    450K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine
    residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category
    and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used
    two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n=62; four brain regions, n=121-133)
    and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n=149).  Results:
    We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation
    levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene
    promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
    NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5,
    SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
    SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1,SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly,
    the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
    that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
    Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific
    as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.  Conclusions:
    Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated
    with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk
    allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study highlights the
    importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way to understand
    the molecular basis of genetic variants associated to human diseases and traits.'

  title: Abundant Quantitative Trait Loci for CpG Methylation and Expression Across
    Human Brain Tissues
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: A fundamental challenge in the post-genome era is to understand and annotate
    the consequences of genetic variation, particularly within the context of human
    tissues. We describe a set of integrated experiments designed to investigate the
    effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation, mRNA expression and
    microRNA (miRNA) expression in four distinct human brain regions. We show that
    brain tissues may be readily distinguished based on methylation status or expression
    profile. We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation mRNA expression and show
    for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation. We
    observe that the largest magnitude effects occur across distinct brain regions.
    We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will be useful in
    understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.Authorized Access data:Mapping

  title: Implications of epigenetic drift in colorectal neoplasia
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Many normal tissues undergo age-related DNA methylation drift  providing
    a quantitative measure of tissue age. However  this drift has not been demonstrated
    in neoplastic tissues. Here we identify and validate 781 CpG-islands (CGIs) that
    undergo significant methylomic drift in normal colorectal tissues  continue to
    drift in neoplasia and remain significantly correlated with one another across
    tissue samples. However  compared with normal colon  this drift advances (~3-4
    fold) faster in neoplasia consistent with increased cell proliferation during
    neoplastic progression. Furthermore  we show that the observed drift patterns
    are broadly consistent with modeled adenoma-carcinoma sojourn time distributions
    from colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence data. These results support the hypothesis
    that  beginning with the founder premalignant cell  cancer precursors frequently
    sojourn for decades before turning into cancer which implies that the founder
    cell typically arises early in life. We estimate that at least 77-89% of the observed
    drift variance in distal and rectal tumors is explained by stochastic variability
    associated with neoplastic progression  while only 55% of the variance is explained
    for proximal tumors. However  >50%  of identified gene-CGI pairs in the proximal
    colon that undergo drift are significantly and mainly negatively correlated with
    cancer gene expression  suggesting that methylomic drift participates in the clonal
    evolution of CRCs.  Significance:  Methylomic drift advances in colorectal neoplasia
    consistent with extended sojourn time distributions explaining a significant fraction
    of epigenetic heterogeneity in CRCs. Importantly  the estimated long-duration
    premalignant sojourn times suggest that early dietary and lifestyle interventions
    may be more effective than later changes in reducing CRC incidence.'

  title: Altered DNA methylation profiles in blood from patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
    disease
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Prion diseases are fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative disorders\
    \ caused by the misfolding and aggregation of prion protein. Although recent studies\
    \ have implicated epigenetic variation in common neurodegenerative disorders,\
    \ no study has yet explored their role in human prion diseases. Here we profiled\
    \ genome-wide blood DNA methylation in the most common human prion disease, sporadic\
    \ Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Our case-control study (n=219), when accounting\
    \ for differences in cell type composition between individuals, identified 38\
    \ probes at genome-wide significance (p\u2009<\u20091.24x10-7). Nine of these\
    \ sites were taken forward in a replication study, performed in an independent\
    \ case-control (n=186) cohort using pyrosequencing. Sites in or close to FKBP5,\
    \ AIM2 (2 probes), UHRF1, KCNAB2, PRNP, ANK1 successfully replicated. The blood-based\
    \ DNA methylation signal was tissue- and disease-specific, in that the replicated\
    \ probe signals were unchanged in case-control studies using sCJD frontal-cortex\
    \ (n=84), blood samples from patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and from\
    \ inherited and acquired prion diseases. Machine learning algorithms using blood\
    \ DNA methylation array profiles accurately distinguished sCJD patients and controls.\
    \ Finally, we identified sites whose methylation levels associated with prolonged\
    \ survival in sCJD patients. Altogether, this study has identified a peripheral\
    \ DNA methylation signature of sCJD with a variety of potential biomarker applications."

  title: DNA methylation signature of human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of behavioural\
    \ and cognitive deficits, which may affect between 2-5% of children in North America.\
    \ While the underlying mechanisms of alcohol\u2019s effects on development remain\
    \ relatively unknown, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms in mediating\
    \ the range of symptoms observed in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder\
    \ (FASD). Thus, we investigated the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on genome-wide\
    \ DNA methylation in the NeuroDevNet FASD cohort, the largest cohort of human\
    \ FASD samples to date. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of buccal epithelial\
    \ cells were analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array on a Canadian\
    \ cohort of 206 children (110 FASD and 96 controls). Genotyping was performed\
    \ in parallel using the Infinium HumanOmni2.5-Quad v1.0 BeadChip. After correcting\
    \ for the effects of genetic background, 658 significantly differentially methylated\
    \ sites between FASD cases and controls remained, with 41 displaying differences\
    \ in beta greater than 5%. Furthermore, 203 differentially methylated regions\
    \ containing 2 or more CpGs were also identified, overlapping with 167 different\
    \ genes. The majority of differentially methylated genes were highly expressed\
    \ in samples from the Allen Brain Atlas, which showed high correlations with buccal\
    \ cell DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, over-representation analysis of\
    \ the up-methylated genes displayed a significant enrichment for neurodevelopmental\
    \ processes and diseases, such as anxiety, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders.\
    \ These findings suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with distinct\
    \ DNA methylation patterns in children and adolescents, raising the possibility\
    \ of an epigenetic biomarker of FASD."

  title: DNA methylation and inflammation marker profiles associated with a history
    of depression.
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Depression is a common and disabling disorder, representing a major social\
    \ and economic health issue. Moreover, depression is associated with the progression\
    \ of diseases with an inflammatory etiology including many inflammatory-related\
    \ disorders. At the molecular level, the mechanisms by which depression might\
    \ promote the onset of these diseases and associated immune-dysfunction are not\
    \ well understood. In this study we assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation\
    \ in whole blood-derived DNA obtained from individuals with a self-reported history\
    \ of depression (n=100) and individuals without a history of depression (n=100)\
    \ using the Illumina 450K microarray. Our analysis identified 6 significant (Sidak\
    \ corrected\_P < 0.05) depression-associated differentially methylated regions\
    \ (DMRs); the top-ranked DMR was located in exon 1 of the LTB4R2 gene (Sidak corrected\
    \ P = 1.27 x 10-14). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression were generated\
    \ and known biological markers of inflammation, telomere length (TL) and IL-6,\
    \ were measured in DNA and serum samples respectively. Next, we employed a systems-level\
    \ approach to identify networks of co-methylated loci associated with a history\
    \ of depression, in addition to depression PRS, TL and IL-6 levels. Our analysis\
    \ identified one depression-associated co-methylation module (P = 0.04). Interestingly,\
    \ the depression-associated module was highly enriched for pathways related to\
    \ immune function and was also associated with TL and IL-6 cytokine levels. In\
    \ summary, our genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of individuals with and without\
    \ a self-reported history of depression identified several candidate DMRs of potential\
    \ relevance to the pathogenesis of depression and its associated immune-dysfunction\
    \ phenotype."

  summary: "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder caused by\
    \ altered neuronal and glial cell functions. Illumina 450K profiling of cells\

    \ A distinct set of age independent AD-specific DMCGs shows strong cell specific\
    \ changes in the genes TOLLIP, BACE2, PKAR1B, PDE9A, ROBO2, FERMT2, UGT8, SPON1,\
    \ INPP5D, LNFG and SRPK2. Some AD-specific DMCGs even reveal incremental changes\
    \ with advancing BRAAK stages. In summary we observe a striking presence of DMCGs\

  title: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in progression to in situ and invasive
    carcinoma of the breast with impact on gene transcription and prognosis
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a precursor of invasive
    breast carcinoma (IBC). DNA methylation alterations are thought to be an early
    event in progression of cancer, and may prove valuable as a tool in clinical decision
    making and for understanding neoplastic development. Genome-wide DNA methylation
    profiles of 285 breast tissue samples representing progression of cancer were
    generated using Illumina HumanMethylation450. Validation of methylation changes
    between normal and DCIS was performed in an independent dataset of 15 normal and
    40 DCIS samples, and validation of a prognostic signature was performed on 583
    breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using two independent datasets
    of normal breast tissue and DCIS revealed that DNA methylation profiles of DCIS
    were radically altered compared to normal breast tissue, involving almost 7000
    genes (including CUL7 and ICAM2).  Changes between DCIS and IBC involved around
    1000 genes. In tumors, DNA methylation was associated with gene expression of
    almost 3000 genes (p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected) including both negative and positive
    correlations. A prognostic signature based on methylation level of 18 CpGs (representing
    genes such as IRF6, TBX5, ZNF259, KCTD21, EPN3, MACF1 and CSNK1G2) was associated
    to survival of breast cancer patients with invasive tumors, as well as to survival
    of patients with DCIS and mixed lesions of DCIS and IBC. This work demonstrates
    that changes in the epigenome occurs early in the neoplastic progression, provide
    evidence for the possible utilization of DNA methylation based markers of progression
    in the clinic, and highlights the importance of epigenetic changes in carcinogenesis.

  title: Methylome-wide analysis of chronic HIV infected patients and healthy controls
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Current therapy has turned HIV infection into a chronic condition. Clinically,
    some patients suffer prematurely from ailments associated with advanced age; however,
    the relationship between HIV and aging is unclear. Here we have collected a large
    cohort of HAART treated HIV+ subjects with both recent and chronic infection and
    recapitulated the shared phenotype of HIV and age. To further understand this
    signal, we applied validated models of DNA methylation-based biological age to
    establish a clear link between HIV infection and molecular age advancement. We
    then show this result to be robust to HIV duration, cellular composition, and
    general methylome disorder. Finally we show a pattern of hypomethylation in HIV+
    individuals at the HLA locus. Together these results lead to a much-needed better
    understanding of the epigenetic consequences and gerontological aspects of chronic
    HIV infection.

  title: Radiomic subtyping improves disease stratification beyond key molecular,
    clinical and standard imaging characteristics in patients with glioblastoma.
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: To analyze the potential of radiomics for disease stratification\
    \ beyond key molecular, clinical and standard imaging features in patients with\
    \ glioblastoma.Methods: Quantitative imaging features (n=1043) were extracted\
    \ from the multiparametric MRI of 181 patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma\
    \ prior to standard-of-care treatment (allocated to a discovery and validation\
    \ set, 2:1 ratio). A subset of 386/1043 features were identified as reproducible\
    \ (in an independent MRI-test-retest cohort) and selected for analysis. A penalized\
    \ Cox-model with 10-fold cross-validation (Coxnet) was fitted on the discovery\
    \ set to construct a radiomic signature for predicting progression-free and overall\
    \ survival (PFS, OS). The incremental value of a radiomic signature beyond molecular\
    \ (MGMT-promoter methylation, DNA-methylation subgroups), clinical (patients age,\
    \ KPS, extent-of-resection, adjuvant treatment) and standard imaging parameters\
    \ (tumor volumes) for stratifying PFS and OS was assessed with multivariate Cox-models\
    \ (performance quantified with prediction error curves).Results: The radiomic\
    \ signature (constructed from 8/386 features identified through Coxnet) increased\
    \ the prediction accuracy for PFS and OS (in both discovery and validation set)\
    \ beyond the assessed molecular, clinical and standard imaging parameters (p\u2264\
    0.01). Prediction errors decreased by 36% for PFS and 37% for OS when adding the\
    \ radiomic signature (as compared to 29% and 27% with molecular + clinical features\
    \ alone). The radiomic signature was - along with MGMT-status - the only parameter\
    \ with independent significance on multivariate analysis (p\u22640.01).Conclusions:\
    \ Our study stresses the role of integrating radiomics into a multi-layer decision\
    \ framework with key molecular and clinical features to improve disease stratification\
    \ and to potentially advance personalized treatment of patients with glioblastoma."

  title: The PedBE clock estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [dataset
    7, WSFW]
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily  focused
    on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool  for measuring biological
    age that shows impressive accuracy across  most tissues and age ranges. In adults,
    deviations from the DNA  methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with
    several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children,  however,
    fewer such associations have been made, possibly because  DNAm changes are more
    dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. To address this crucial
    gap, we aimed to  develop a highly accurate, noninvasive biological measure age  specific
    to pediatric samples by using buccal epithelial cell  DNAm. We gathered 1,721
    genome-wide DNAm profiles from  11 different cohorts of typically developing individuals
    aged 0 to  20 y old. Elastic net penalized regression was used to select 94  CpG
    sites from a training dataset (n = 1,032) and the performance was assessed in
    a separate dataset (n = 689). The DNAm  at 94 CpG sites was highly predictive
    of age in the test cohorts  (median absolute error = 0.35 y). The Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic
    (PedBE)  clock was characterized in additional cohorts, showcasing the accuracy
    in longitudinal data, the performance in nonbuccal tissues and  adult age ranges,
    and the association with obstetric outcomes. The  PedBE tool for measuring biological
    age in children might help in  understanding the environmental and contextual
    factors that shape  the DNA methylome during child development, and how it, in  turn,
    might relate to child health and disease.

  title: Epigenome analysis of normal colon mucosa samples
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: To investigate whether lifestyle factors modulate the stability of gene
    promoter methylation in the normal aging colonic mucosa, we performed genome-scale
    DNA methylation profiling of 178 normal colon biopsies using the Illumina Infinium
    DNA methylation assay, which assesses the DNA methylation status of 27,578 CpG
    sites located at the promoter regions of 14,495 protein-coding genes. We identified
    Aspirin use and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) suppress, whereas a high body
    mass index (BMI) and smoking promote age-related hyermethylation. Many of these
    loci modulated by lifestyle in the healthy colon mucosa coincide with loci hypermethylated
    in colorectal cancers and down-regulated in adenomas. The data show that lifestyle
    modulates the stability of DNA methylation in the aging colonic epithelium and
    thereby impacts the rate of evolution of cancer methylomes.

  title: "The Biological Embedding of Early Life Socioeconomic and Family Adversity\
    \ in Children\u2019s Genome-wide DNA Methylation"
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Early life social experiences are believed to confer persistent effects\
    \ on individual\u2019s biology and subsequent functioning and health. Using a\
    \ diverse, longitudinal community sample of 178 children, we show that three different\
    \ types of early life social experience: family income, parental education, and\
    \ family psychosocial adversity, each predict DNA methylation within buccal epithelial\
    \ cells. Each predictor was significantly associated with DNA methylation within\
    \ a unique set of genomic CpG sites, with income showing the greatest number of\
    \ associations. Findings were independently verified using pyrosequencing. Our\
    \ results provide evidence for longitudinal associations between early life social\
    \ environment and variation in DNA methylation during childhood, after adjusting\
    \ for genetic ancestry and self-reported ethnic minority status. Gene ontology\
    \ analyses of top, differentially methylated CpG sites point to genes serving\
    \ immune and developmental regulation functions, suggesting potential pathways\
    \ for the biological embedding of early life stress and its association with later\
    \ development and health."

  title: Correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in the brains of
    patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression have been reported in postmortem\
    \ brain tissues of psychotic patients, but until now there has been no systematic\
    \ evaluation of synergistic changes in methylation and expression on a genome-wide\
    \ scale in brain tissue. In this study, genome-wide methylation and expression\
    \ analyses were performed on cerebellum samples from 39 patients with schizophrenia,\
    \ 36 patients with bipolar disorder, and 43 unaffected controls, to screen for\
    \ a correlation between gene expression and CpG methylation. Out of 71,753 CpG\
    \ gene pairs (CGPs) tested across the genome, 204 were found to signi\uFB01cantly\
    \ correlate with gene expression after correction for multiple testing [p < 0.05,\
    \ false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05]. The correlated CGPs were tested for disease-associated\
    \ expression and methylation by comparing psychotic patients with bipolar disorder\
    \ and schizophrenia to healthy controls. Four of the identi\uFB01ed CGPs were\
    \ found to signi\uFB01cantly correlate with the differential expression and methylation\
    \ of genes encoding phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1),\
    \ butyrophilin, subfamily 3, member A3 (BTN3A3), nescient helix-loop-helix 1 (NHLH1),\
    \ and solute carrier family 16, member 7 (SLC16A7) in psychotic patients (p <\
    \ 0.05, FDR q < 0.2). Additional expression and methylation datasets wereused\
    \ to validate the relationship between DNA methylation, gene expression, and neuropsychiatric\
    \ diseases. These results suggest that the identi\uFB01ed differentially expressed\
    \ genes with an aberrant methylation pattern may represent novel candidate factors\
    \ in the etiology and pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders."

  title: DNA Methylation Markers Predict Recurrence-free Interval in Triple-Negative
    Breast Cancer.
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We lack tools to risk-stratify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our
    goal was to develop molecular tools to predict disease recurrence. Methylation
    array analysis was performed on 110 samples treated by locoregional therapy obtained
    from Institutional cohorts. Discovered marker sets were then tested by Kaplan
    Meier analyses in a prospectively collected TNBC cohort of 49 samples from the
    no chemotherapy arms of IBCSG trials VIII and IX, and by logistic regression in
    a chemotherapy-treated cohort of 121 TNBCs from combined IBCSG trials and Institutional
    repositories. High methylation was associated with shorter recurrence-free interval
    in the no chemotherapy arm of the IBCSG studies, as well as in the chemotherapy-treated
    patients within the combined Institutional and IBCSG chemotherapy cohorts (100
    marker panel, P=0.002; 30 marker panel, P=0.05). Chromosome 19 sites were enriched
    among these loci. In conclusion, our hypermethylation signatures identify increased
    recurrence risk independent of whether patients receive chemotherapy.

  title: Epigenetic profiling and response to CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
    T-cell therapy in B-cell malignancies
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells directed against CD19 (CART19)
    are effective in relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. Not all patients
    show treatment efficacy, but little is known about the molecular factors predicting
    clinical outcome of CART19 therapy. Our objective was to determine the effect
    of epigenetic changes in CART19 cells on the clinical course of B-cell malignancy
    patients treated with adoptive therapy. We report a case series of B-cell malignancy
    patients (68 males (M) and 46 females (F); median age of 24 years (range 3-70
    years)), comprising 77 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 37 non-Hodgkin
    lymphoma (NHL) cases, who were treated with CART19 cells. Using a DNA methylation
    microarray, we determined the epigenomic changes that occur in the patient T-cells
    upon transduction of the CAR vector. We identified 984 genomic sites with differential
    DNA methylation between CAR-untransduced (UT) and CAR-transduced (TD) T-cells
    before infusion into the patient. 18 of these distinct epigenetic loci were significantly
    associated with complete response (CR). Using the sites linked to CR, the EPICART
    signature was established, which was associated with enhanced overall survival
    (OS).

  title: "Identification of a key role of widespread epigenetic drift in Barrett\u2019\
    s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma"
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Our analysis reveals\_an\_extensive methylomic drift between normal squamous\
    \ esophagus and BE tissues in nonprogressed BE patients, with differential drift\
    \ affecting 4024 (24%) of 16,984 normally hypomethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides\
    \ (CpGs) occurring in CpG islands. The majority (63%) of islands that include\
    \ drift CpGs are associated with gene promoter regions. Island CpGs that drift\
    \ have stronger pairwise correlations than static islands, reflecting collective\
    \ drift consistent with processive DNA methylation maintenance. Individual BE\
    \ tissues are extremely heterogeneous in their distribution of methylomic drift\
    \ and encompass unimodal low-drift to bimodal high-drift patterns, reflective\
    \ of differences in BE tissue age. Further analysis of longitudinally collected\
    \ biopsy samples from 20 BE patients confirm the time-dependent evolution of these\
    \ drift patterns. Drift patterns in EAC are similar to those in BE, but frequently\
    \ exhibit enhanced bimodality and advanced mode drift. To better understand the\
    \ observed drift patterns, we developed a multicellular stochastic model at the\
    \ CpG island level. Importantly, we find that nonlinear feedback in the model\
    \ between mean island methylation and CpG methylation rates is able to explain\
    \ the widely heterogeneous collective drift patterns. Using matched gene expression\
    \ and DNA methylation data in EAC from TCGA and other publically available data,\
    \ we also find that advanced methylomic drift is correlated with significant transcriptional\
    \ repression of ~\u2009200 genes\_in important regulatory and developmental pathways,\
    \ including several checkpoint and tumor suppressor-like genes. Taken together,\
    \ our findings suggest that epigenetic drift evolution acts to significantly reduce\
    \ the expression of developmental genes that may alter tissue characteristics\
    \ and improve functional adaptation during BE and EAC progression."

  title: DNA methylation profiling reveals novel biomarkers and important roles for
    DNA methyltransferases in prostate cancer
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal and tumor prostate samples,
    as well as cultured primary prostate cells overexpressing DNA Methyltransferases
    (DNMTs) and EZH2Candidate gene based studies have identified a handful of aberrant
    CpG DNA methylation events in prostate cancer. However, DNA methylation profiles
    have not been compared on a large scale between prostate tumor and normal prostate,
    and the mechanisms behind these alterations are unknown. In this study, we quantitatively
    profiled 95 primary prostate tumors and 86 healthy prostate tissue samples for
    their DNA methylation levels at 26,333 CpGs representing 14,104 gene promoters
    by using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 platform. A 2-class Significance Analysis
    of this dataset revealed 5,912 CpG sites with increased DNA methylation and 2,151
    CpG sites with decreased DNA methylation in tumors (FDR < 0.8%). Prediction Analysis
    of this dataset identified 87 CpGs that are the most predictive diagnostic methylation
    biomarkers of prostate cancer. By integrating available clinical follow-up data,
    we also identified 69 prognostic DNA methylation alterations that correlate with
    biochemical recurrence of the tumor. To identify the mechanisms responsible for
    these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression
    levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins
    by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2
    in tumors. Subsequent transient transfection assays in cultured primary prostate
    cells revealed that DNMT3B1 and DNMT3B2 overexpression resulted in increased methylation
    of a substantial subset of CpG sites that also showed tumor-specific increased
    methylation.

  title: DNA methylation as a mediator of the association between prenatal adversity
    and risk factors for metabolic disease in adulthood
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Although it is assumed that epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in\
    \ DNA methylation (DNAm), underlie the relationship between adverse intrauterine\
    \ conditions and adult metabolic health, evidence from human studies remains scarce.\
    \ Therefore, we evaluated whether DNAm in whole blood mediated the association\
    \ between prenatal famine exposure and metabolic health in 422 individuals exposed\
    \ to famine in utero and 463 (sibling) controls. We implemented a two-step analysis,\
    \ namely, a genome-wide exploration across 342,596 cytosine-phosphate-guanine\
    \ dinucleotides (CpGs) for potential mediators of the association between prenatal\
    \ famine exposure and adult body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides (TG), or\
    \ glucose concentrations, which was followed by formal mediation analysis. DNAm\
    \ mediated the association of prenatal famine exposure with adult BMI and TG but\
    \ not with glucose. DNAm at PIM3 (cg09349128), a gene involved in energy metabolism,\
    \ mediated 13.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5 to 28%] of the association between\
    \ famine exposure and BMI. DNAm at six CpGs, including TXNIP (cg19693031), influencing\
    \ \u03B2 cell function, and ABCG1 (cg07397296), affecting lipid metabolism, together\
    \ mediated 80% (95% CI, 38.5 to 100%) of the association between famine exposure\
    \ and TG. Analyses restricted to those exposed to famine during early gestation\
    \ identified additional CpGs mediating the relationship with TG near PFKFB3 (glycolysis)\
    \ and METTL8 (adipogenesis). DNAm at the CpGs involved was associated with gene\
    \ expression in an external data set and correlated with DNAm levels in fat depots\
    \ in additional postmortem data. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that\
    \ epigenetic mechanisms mediate the influence of transient adverse environmental\
    \ factors in early life on long-term metabolic health. The specific mechanism\
    \ awaits elucidation."

  title: DNA methylation analyses of urothelial carcinoma reveal distinct epigenetic
    subtypes and an association between gene copy number and methylation status
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We assessed DNA methylation and copy number status of 27,000 CpGs in 149
    urothelial carcinomas and integrated the findings with gene expression and mutation
    data. Methylation was associated with gene expression for 1,332 CpGs, of which
    26% showed positive correlation with expression, i.e., high methylation and high
    gene expression levels. These positively correlated CpGs were part of specific
    transcription factor binding sites, such as sites for MYC and CREBP1, or located
    in gene bodies. Furthermore, we found genes with copy number gains, low expression
    and high methylation levels, revealing an association between methylation and
    copy number levels. This phenomenon was typically observed for developmental genes,
    such as HOX genes and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, we also identified
    genes with copy number gains, high expression and low methylation levels. This
    was for instance observed for some keratin genes. Tumor cases could be grouped
    into four subgroups, termed epitypes, by their DNA methylation profiles. One epitype
    was influenced by the presence of infiltrating immune cells, two epitypes were
    mainly composed of non-muscle invasive tumors, and the remaining epitype of muscle
    invasive tumors. The polycomb complex protein EZH2 that blocks differentiation
    in embryonic stem cells showed increased expression both at the mRNA and protein
    levels in the muscle invasive epitype, together with methylation of polycomb target
    genes and HOX genes. Our data highlights HOX gene silencing and EZH2 expression
    as mechanisms to promote a more undifferentiated and aggressive state in UC.

  title: DNA Methylation Differences Associated with Social Anxiety Disorder and Early
    Life Adversity
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by
    extensive fear in social situations. Multiple genetic and environmental factors
    are known to contribute to its pathogenesis. One of the main environmental risk
    factors is early life adversity (ELA). Evidence is emerging that epigenetic mechanisms
    such as DNA methylation might play an important role in the biological mechanisms
    underlying SAD and ELA. To investigate the relationship between ELA, DNA methylation,
    and SAD, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for SAD and ELA examining
    DNA from whole blood of a cohort of 143 individuals using DNA methylation arrays.
    We identified two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with SAD
    located within the genes SLC43A2 and TNXB. As this was the first epigenome-wide
    association study for SAD, it is worth noting that both genes have previously
    been associated with panic disorder. Further, we identified two DMRs associated
    with ELA within the SLC17A3 promoter region and the SIAH3 gene and several DMRs
    that were associated with the interaction of SAD and ELA. Of these, the regions
    within C2CD2L and MRPL28 showed the largest difference in DNA methylation. Lastly,
    we found that two DMRs were associated with both the severity of social anxiety
    and ELA, however, neither of them was found to mediate the contribution of ELA
    to SAD later in life. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings in independent
    cohorts and to investigate the biological pathways underlying these effects.

  title: "Epigenetic profiling in CD4 and CD8 T cells from Graves\u2019 disease patients\
    \ reveals changes in genes associated with T cell receptor signaling [methylation]"
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "In Graves\u2019 disease (GD), a combination of genetic, epigenetic and\
    \ environmental factors causes an autoimmune response to the thyroid gland, characterized\
    \ by lymphocytic infiltrations and autoantibodies targeting the thyroid stimulating\
    \ hormone receptor (TSHR) and other thyroid antigens. To identify the epigenetic\
    \ changes involved in GD, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation\
    \ and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+\
    \ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and\
    \ CD8+ T cells, respectively. Among the hypermethylated CpG sites, we specifically\
    \ found enrichment of genes involved in T cell signaling (CD247, LCK, ZAP70, CD3D,\
    \ CD3E, CD3G, CTLA4 and CD8A) and decreased expression of CD3 gene family members.\
    \ The hypermethylation was accompanied with the active chromatin histone modifications\
    \ as we found decreased signals of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks at several T cell\
    \ signaling genes in ChIP-seq analysis. In addition, we found hypermethylation\
    \ of the TSHR gene first intron, where several GD-associated polymorphisms are\
    \ located. Our results demonstrate an involvement of dysregulated DNA methylation\
    \ and histone modifications at T cell signaling genes in GD patients."

  title: The methylome of DDR genes and benefit from RT or TMZ in IDH mutant low grade
    glioma treated in EORTC 22033
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Treatment modalities for patients with low grade glioma (LGG) WHO grade
    II are controversial. Overall survival ranges from 2 to over 15 years depending
    on molecular and clinical factors. Hence, risk adjusted treatments are required
    to preserve cognitive function and quality of life. We aim at identifying mechanisms
    and associated molecular markers predicting benefit from radiotherapy (RT) or
    temozolomide (TMZ) on progression free survival in 120 isocitrate dehydrogenase
    1 or 2 (IDHmt) mutant LGG treated in the randomized phase III trial EORTC 22033.
    IDH mutations, the characteristic hallmark of LGG, are associated with a CpG island
    methylator phenotype (CIMP). Given the genotoxic treatments in this study we determined
    the DNA methylome of DNA damage response (DDR) genes and assessed the association
    with progression free survival (PFS). We identified 62 functional CpGs corresponding
    to 24 of 410 DDR genes in the multidimensional LGG dataset from The Cancer Genome
    Atlas. Despite the low-powered study, the simulations suggested that seven CpGs,
    associated with 4 genes could be predictive for PFS in EORTC 22033. Most interestingly,
    two of the CpGs correspond to MGMT and consisted of the 2 probes used in the MGMT-STP27
    classifier. The extent of methylation was predictive for PFS in the TMZ, but not
    the RT arm. LGG IDHmt and 1p and 19q codeleted that overlap largely with oligodendroglioma
    displayed a higher extent of MGMT methylation than the IDHmt non-codeleted tumors
    based on several independent LGG datasets. This is consistent with a better PFS
    of codeleted patients in the TMZ arm as compared to the non-codeleted patients,
    while no difference was observed in the RT-arm.

  title: DNA extracted from saliva for methylation studies of psychiatric traits
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation has become increasingly recognized in the etiology of psychiatric
    disorders. Because brain tissue is not accessible in living humans, epigenetic
    studies are most often conducted in blood. Saliva is often collected for genotyping
    studies but is rarely used to examine DNA methylation because the proportion of
    epithelial cells and leukocytes varies extensively between individuals.  The goal
    of this study was to evaluate whether saliva DNA is informative for studies of
    psychiatric disorders.   Saliva and blood methylation was clearly distinguishable
    though there was positive correlation overall. There was little correlation in
    CpG sites within relevant candidate genes.  Correlated CpG sites were more likely
    to occur in areas of low CpG density (i.e. CpG shores and open seas). There was
    more variability in CpG sites from saliva than blood, which may reflect its heterogeneity.
    Thus, this study provides a framework for using DNA methylation from saliva and
    suggests that DNA methylation of saliva may offer distinct opportunities for epidemiological
    and longitudinal studies of psychiatric traits.

  title: Epigenome analysis of normal breast samples
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Despite known age-related DNA methylation (aDNAm) changes in breast tumors,\
    \ little is known about aDNAm in normal breast tissues. Breast tissues from a\
    \ cross-sectional study of 121 cancer-free women, were assayed for genome-wide\
    \ DNA methylation. mRNA expression was assayed by microarray technology. Analysis\
    \ of covariance was used to identify aDNAm\u2019s. Altered methylation was correlated\
    \ with expression of the corresponding gene and with DNA methyltransferase protein\
    \ DNMT3A, assayed by immunohistochemistry. Publically-available TCGA data were\
    \ used for replication. 1,214 aDNAm\u2019s were identified; 97% with increased\
    \ methylation, and all on autosomes. Sites with increased methylation were predominantly\
    \ in CpG lslands and non-enhancers. aDNAm\u2019s with decreased methylation were\
    \ generally located in intergenic regions, non-CpG Islands, and enhancers. Of\
    \ the aDNAm\u2019s identified, 650 are known to be involved in cancer, including\
    \ ESR1 and beta-estradiol responsive genes. Expression of DNMT3A was positively\
    \ associated with age. Two aDNAm\u2019s showed significant associations with DNMT3A\
    \ expression; KRR1 (OR 6.57, 95% CI: 2.51-17.23) and DHRS12 (OR 6.08, 95% CI:\
    \ 2.33-15.86). A subset of aDNAm\u2019s co-localized within vulnerable regions\
    \ for somatic mutations in breast cancer. Expression of C19orf48 was inversely\
    \ and significantly correlated with its methylation level. In the TCGA dataset,\
    \ 84% and 64% of the previously identified aDNAm\u2019s were correlated with age\
    \ in both normal-adjacent and tumor breast tissues, with differential associations\
    \ by histological subtype. Given the similarity of findings in the breast tissues\
    \ of healthy women and breast tumors, and the effects on gene expression, aDNAm\u2019\
    s may be one pathway for increased breast cancer risk with age."

  title: Global Methylation Profiles in Buccal Cells of Long-Term Smokers and Moist
    Snuff Consumers
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Alternations in gene methylation and other epigenetic changes regulate
    normal development as well as drive disease progression. Chronic cigarette smoking
    causes hyper- and hypo-methylation of genes that could contribute to smoking-related
    diseases. It is unclear whether consumers of non-combustible tobacco, such as
    moist snuff, also exhibit such perturbations in their methylome. Here, we present
    global methylation changes relative to non-tobacco consumers in buccal cells collected
    from smokers (SMK) and moist snuff consumers (MSC). Generally healthy adult male
    study subjects were recruited into SMK, MSC and Non-Tobacco Consumer (NTC) cohorts
    (40 subjects/cohort). Global methylation profiling was performed on the Illumina
    450K methylation array using buccal cell DNA. A total of 1,252 loci were found
    to be significantly differentially methylated in tobacco consumers relative to
    non-tobacco consumers. Overall, the SMK cohort exhibited larger qualitative and
    quantitative changes relative to MSC. Approximately half of the total number of
    gene loci, classified as Combustible Tobacco-Related signatures, and a third of
    the changes, termed Tobacco-Related signatures, were commonly detected in the
    tobacco consumers. Very few differences were detected between MSC and NTC, and
    hierarchical clustering of the top 50 significant gene loci suggested that MSC
    and NTC co-cluster. Consistent with physiological functions of AhR, combustible
    tobacco drives profound changes in buccal cell methylation status, principally
    impacting cell development and immune response pathways. These results aid in
    placing combustible and non-combustible tobacco products along a risk continuum
    and provide additional insights into the effects of tobacco consumption.

  title: Genome-scale analysis of DNA methylation in lung adenocarcinoma and integration
    with mRNA expression
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and adenocarcinoma
    is its most common histological subtype. Clinical and molecular evidence indicates
    that lung adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, which has important implications
    for treatment. Here we performed genome-scale DNA methylation profiling using
    the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 platform on 59 matched lung adenocarcinoma/non-tumor
    lung samples, with genome-scale verification on an independent set of tissues.
    We identified 766 genes showing altered DNA methylation between tumors and non-tumor
    lung.  By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we identified
    164 hypermethylated genes showing concurrent downregulation, and 57 hypomethylated
    genes showing increased expression. Integrated pathways analysis indicates that
    these genes are involved in cell differentiation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition,
    RAS and WNT signaling pathways and cell cycle regulation, among others. Comparison
    of DNA methylation profiles between lung adenocarcinomas of current and never-smokers
    showed modest differences, identifying only LGALS4 as significantly hypermethylated
    and downregulated in smokers. LGALS4, encoding a galactoside-binding protein involved
    in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, was recently shown to be a tumor-suppressor
    in colorectal cancer. Unsupervised analysis of the DNA methylation data identified
    two tumor subgroups, one of which showed increased DNA methylation and was significantly
    associated with KRAS mutation and to a lesser extent, with smoking. Our analysis
    lays the groundwork for further molecular studies of lung adenocarcinoma by providing
    new candidate DNA methylation biomarkers for early detection, identifying novel
    molecular alterations potentially involved in lung adenocarcinoma development/progression,
    and describing an epigenetic subgroup of lung adenocarcinoma associated with KRAS
    mutation.

  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We generated genome-wide methylation data using the 450K from freshly isolated
    airway epithelial cells of asthmatics and non-asthmatics. This data was paired
    with genome-wide genetic and gene expression data from the same individuals allowing
    for an integrated analysis of genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic signatures

  title: DNA methylation status predicts survival in metastasis free clear cell renal
    cell carcinoma
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) display divergent
    clinical phenotypes. Up to one third of patients with local disease at diagnosis
    will progress. Therefore, it is a need to identify patients at risk for recurrence.
    In the present study, we analyzed genome-wide promoter DNA methylation at diagnosis
    in relation to clinicopathological parameters, in order to identify DNA methylation
    profiles associated with risk for progress. Method: DNA methylation status in
    155,931 CpGs located in gene promoter regions was analyzed by Illumina HumanMethylation450K
    arrays in diagnostic tissue samples from 115 ccRCC patients. Methylation profiles
    were compared with genetic aberrations and clinicopathological parameters. Results:
    The tumors separated into two clusters based on genome-wide promoter methylation
    status. The tumors in these clusters differed in tumor diameter (p < 0.001), TNM
    stage (p < 0.001), morphological grade (p < 0.001), and patients outcome (5 year
    cancer specific survival (pCSS5yr) 72 % in cluster A vs 26 % in cluster B, p <
    0.001). When metastasis-status (M0/M1) and cluster A/B status at diagnosis were
    combined, we found poor survival in M1 patients regardless of cluster A/B status
    (pCSS5yr 9 % vs 6 %). In M0 patients, the cluster status clearly separated in
    survival (pCSS5yr 81 % vs 17 %; p < 0.001). We identified a methylation profile
    of 398 CpGs that was associated with progress of disease, which included differently
    methylated CpG sites in the SMAD6, SOCS3 and MX2 genes.An integrated genomic and
    epigenomic analysis revealed significant correlations between the total number
    of genetic aberrations and hypermethylated CpGs (R = 0.435, p > 0.001), and predicted
    mitotic age (R = 0.407, p < 0.001). Conclusion: DNA methylation analysis at diagnosis
    in ccRCC has the potential to improve outcome-prediction and therapy stratification.'

  title: DNA methylation signatures in airway cells from adult children of asthmatic
    mothers reflect subtypes of severe asthma (DNA methylation)
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Maternal asthma (MA) is among the most consistent risk factors for asthma
    in her children. Possible mechanisms for this observation are epigenetic modifications
    in utero that have lasting effects on developmental programs in children of mothers
    with asthma. To test this hypothesis, we performed differential DNA methylation
    analyses of 398,186 individual CpG sites in primary bronchial epithelial cells
    (BECs) from 42 non-asthma controls and 88 asthma cases, including 56 without MA
    (NMA) and 32 with MA. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
    of 69 and 554 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) that were specific to NMA
    or MA cases, respectively, compared to controls. WGCNA grouped 66 NMA-DMCs and
    203 MA-DMCs into two and five co-methylation modules, respectively. The eigenvector
    of one MA-associated module (turquoise) was uniquely correlated with 85 genes
    expressed in BECs and enriched for 36 pathways, 16 of which discriminated between
    NMA and MA using machine learning. Genes in all 16 pathways were decreased in
    MA compared to NMA cases (P=7.1x10-3), a finding that replicated in nasal epithelial
    cells from an independent cohort (P=0.02). Functional interpretation of these
    pathways suggested impaired T cell signaling and responses to viral and bacterial
    pathogens. The MA-associated turquoise module eigenvector was additionally correlated
    with clinical features of severe asthma and reflective of type 2 (T2)-low asthma
    (i.e., low total serum IgE, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and eosinophilia).
    Overall, these data suggest that maternal asthma alters diverse epigenetically-mediated
    pathways that lead to distinct subtypes of severe asthma in adults including hard-to-treat
    T2-low asthma.

  title: "DNA Methylation subclass\_Receptor Tyrosine Kinase II (RTK II)\_is predictive\
    \ for seizure development in glioblastoma patients"
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: Seizures can present at any time before or after the diagnosis
    of a glioma. Roughly, 25-30 % of glioblastoma (GBM) patients initially present
    with seizures, and an additional 30 % develop seizures during the course of the
    disease. Early studies failed to show an effect of general administration of anti-epileptic
    drugs for glioblastoma patients, since they were unable to stratify patients into
    high- or low- risk seizure groups.  Methods: 112 patients, who underwent surgery
    for a GBM, were included. Genome- wide DNA methylation profiling was performed,
    before methylation subclasses and copy number changes inferred from methylation
    data were correlated with clinical characteristics. Independently, global gene
    expression was analyzed in GBM methylation subclasses from TCGA datasets (n=68).  Results:
    Receptor tyrosine Kinase (RTK) II GBM showed a significantly higher incidence
    of seizures than RTK I and mesenchymal (MES) GBM (p<0.01). Accordingly, RNA expression
    datasets revealed an upregulation of genes involved in neurotransmitter synapses
    and vesicle transport in RTK II glioblastomas. In a multivariate analysis, temporal
    location (p=0.01, OR 6.35) and RTK II (p=0.03, OR 5.56) were most predictive for
    preoperative seizures. During postoperative follow-up, only RTK II remained significantly
    associated with the development of seizures (p<0.01, OR 8.23). Consequently, the
    need for antiepileptic medication and its increase due to treatment failure was
    highly associated with the RTK II methylation subclass (p<0.01).  Conclusion:
    Our study shows a strong correlation of RTK II glioblastomas with preoperative
    and long-term seizures. These results underline the benefit of molecular glioblastoma
    profiling with important implications for postoperative seizure control.'

  summary: Aging is classically conceptualized as an ever-increasing trajectory of
    damage accumulation and loss of function, leading to increases in morbidity and
    mortality. However, recent in vitro studies have raised the possibility of age
    reversal. We characterized several models in which biological age, assessed primarily
    through analysis of DNA methylation, undergoes reversible changes. Severe COVID-19
    is one such example.

  title: Integrated DNA methylation and RNA expression in Small Intestinal neuroendocrine
    tumors
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Background and Aims Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SINETs) are
    the commonest malignancy of the small intestine; however underlying pathogenic
    mechanisms remain poorly characterised. Whole genome and exome sequencing has
    demonstrated that SINETs are mutationally quiet with the most frequent known mutation
    in the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B gene (CDKN1B) occurring in only ~8%
    of tumours, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may drive tumourigenesis. The
    aim of this study is to perform genome-wide molecular profiling of SINETs in order
    to identify pathogenic drivers based on molecular profiling. This study represents
    the largest unbiased integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis
    undertaken in this tumour type. Methods Here we present data from integrated molecular
    analysis of SINETs (n=97) including whole exome or targeted CDKN1B sequencing
    (n=29), HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) array profiling (n=69), methylated
    DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (n=16), copy number variance analysis (n=47)
    and Whole Genome-DASL (Illumina) expression array profiling (n=43). Results Based
    on molecular profiling SINETs can be classified in to three groups which demonstrate
    significantly different progression-free survival after resection of primary tumour
    (not reached at 10 years vs 56 months vs 21 months, p=0.04). Epimutations were
    found at a recurrence rate of up to 85% and 21 epigenetically dysregulated genes
    were identified, including CDX1 (86%), CELSR3 (84%), FBP1 (84%) and GIPR (74%).
    Conclusions This is the first comprehensive integrated molecular analysis of SINETs.
    We have demonstrated that these tumours are highly epigenetically dysregulated.
    Furthermore, we have identified novel molecular subtypes with significant impact
    on progression free survival.Background and Aims Small intestinal neuroendocrine
