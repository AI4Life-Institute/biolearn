  title: A coherent approach for analysis of the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip
    improves data quality and performance in epigenome-wide association studies
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline to conduct Epigenome-wide
    Association Studies (EWAS) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip,
    based on data from 2,664 individuals, and 36 samples measured in duplicate. We
    propose new approaches to quality control, data normalisation and batch correction
    through control-probe adjustment, and demonstrate that these improve data-quality.
    Using permutation testing we establish a null hypothesis for EWAS, show how it
    can be affected by correlation between individual methylation markers and present
    methods to restore statistical independence.

  title: Genome-wide association studies identify novel genetic loci for epigenetic
    age acceleration among survivors of childhood cancer [Metadata_SJLIFE1_2138]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: Increased epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in survivors of\
    \ childhood cancer is associated with specific treatment exposures, unfavorable\
    \ health behaviors, and presence of certain chronic health conditions. To better\
    \ understand inter-individual variability, we investigated the genetic basis underlying\
    \ EAA.  Methods: Genome-wide association studies of EAA based on multiple epigenetic\
    \ clocks (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) were performed. MethylationEPIC\
    \ BeadChip array and whole-genome sequencing data were generated with blood-derived\
    \ DNA from participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (discovery: 2,138\
    \ pre-existing and 502 newly generated data, all survivors; exploratory: 282 community\
    \ controls). Linear regression models were fit for each epigenetic age against\
    \ allelic dose of each genetic variant, adjusting for age at sampling, sex, and\
    \ cancer treatment exposures. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine\
    \ summary statistics from two discovery data sets. LD (Linkage disequilibrium)\
    \ score regression was used to estimate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based\
    \ heritability.  Results:  For EAA-Horvath, a genome-wide significant association\
    \ was mapped to SELP gene with the strongest SNP rs732314 (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.57,\
    \ P=3.30\xD710-11). Moreover, the stratified analysis of the association between\
    \ rs732314 and EAA-Horvath showed substantial heterogeneity between children and\
    \ adults (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.97 vs. 0.51, I2=73.1%) as well as between survivors\
    \ with and without chest/abdominal/pelvic-RT exposure (\u03B2=0.64 vs. 0.31, I2=66.3%).\
    \ For EAA-Hannum, an association was mapped to HLA locus with the strongest SNP\
    \ rs28366133 (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.78, P=3.78\xD710-11). There was no genome-wide\
    \ significant hit for EAA-PhenoAge or EAA-GrimAge. Interestingly, among community\
    \ controls, rs732314 was associated with EAA-Horvath (\u03B2=1.09, P=5.43\xD7\
    10-5), whereas rs28366133 was not associated with EAA-Hannum (\u03B2=0.21, P=0.49).\
    \ The estimated heritability was 0.33 (SE=0.20) for EAA-Horvath and 0.17 (SE=0.23)\
    \ for EAA-Hannum, but close to zero for EAA-PhenoAge and EAA-GrimAge.  Conclusions:\
    \ We identified novel genetic variants in SELP gene and HLA region associated\
    \ with EAA-Horvath and EAA-Hannum, respectively, among survivors of childhood\
    \ cancer. The new genetic variants in combination with other replicated known\
    \ variants can facilitate identification of survivors at higher risk in developing\
    \ accelerated aging, and potentially inform drug targets for future intervention\
    \ strategies among vulnerable survivors."

  title: Persistent Variations of Blood DNA Methylation Associated with Treatment
    Exposures and Risk for Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Childhood Cancer Survivors
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: It is well-established that cancer treatment substantially\
    \ increases risk of long-term adverse health outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.\
    \ However, there is limited research on the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate\
    \ the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to\
    \ cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies\
    \ (EWAS) to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment\
    \ exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations\
    \ between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions.Methods: We included\
    \ 2,052 survivors (median age 33.7 years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude\
    \ Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective\
    \ clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation\
    \ were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were\
    \ clinically assessed. DNAm profile was measured using MethylationEPIC BeadChip\
    \ with blood-derived DNA.Results: By performing multiple treatment-specific EWAS,\
    \ we identified 935 5\u2019-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3\u2032 (CpG) sites mapped\
    \ to 538 genes/regions associated with one or more cancer treatments at epigenome-wide\
    \ significance level (P<9\xD710-8). Among the treatment-associated CpGs, 8 were\
    \ associated with obesity, 63 with hypercholesterolemia, and 17 with hypertriglyceridemia\
    \ (False-Discovery-Rate-Adjusted P<0.05). We observed substantial mediation by\
    \ methylation at four independent CpGs (cg06963130, cg21922478, cg22976567, cg07403981)\
    \ for association between abdominal field radiotherapy (abdominal-RT) and risk\
    \ of hypercholesterolemia (70.3%) and by methylation at three CpGs (cg19634849,\
    \ cg13552692, cg09853238) for association between abdominal-RT and hypertriglyceridemia\
    \ (54.6%). In addition, three CpGs (cg26572901, cg12715065, cg21163477) partially\
    \ mediated the association between brain-RT and obesity with 32.9% mediation effect\
    \ and two CpGs mediated the association between corticosteroids and obesity (cg22351187,\
    \ 14.2%) and between brain-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (cg13360224, 10.5%). Notably,\
    \ several mediator CpGs reside in the proximity of well-established dyslipidemia\
    \ genes: cg21922478 (ITGA1) and cg22976567 (LMNA).Conclusions: In childhood cancer\
    \ survivors, cancer treatment exposures are associated with DNAm patterns present\
    \ decades following the exposure. Treatment-associated DNAm sites may mediate\
    \ the causal pathway from specific treatment exposures to certain cardiometabolic\
    \ conditions, suggesting the utility of DNAm sites as risk predictors and potential\
    \ mechanistic targets for future intervention studies."

  title: A DNA Methylation Fingerprint of  1,628 Human Samples
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation is the best characterized of the different layers that
    make up the epigenetic setting. Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation
    patterns have been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of
    human samples and pathological conditions. The recently arrived single-base-resolution
    technologies for DNA methylation are extremely helpful tools, but are not yet
    applicable and affordable for studying large groups of subjects. Herein, we present
    a compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human sample population
    with an intermediate level of resolution of CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained
    a DNA methylation fingerprint of 1,628 human samples where we interrogated 1,505
    CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this epigenetic mark to
    be critical in tissue-type definition and stemness, particularly around transcription
    start sites that are not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA methylation
    fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human cancer cells underwent a progressive
    gain of promoter CpG island hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in
    non-CpG island promoters. Although transformed cells are those where DNA methylation
    disruption is more obvious, we observed that other common human diseases, such
    as neurological and autoimmune disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation
    profiles. Most importantly, we provide proof of principle that the obtained DNA
    methylation fingerprints might be useful for translational purposes by showing
    that are able to identify the tumor type origin of Cancers of Unknown Primary
    (CUPs). Thus, the DNA methylation patterns identified across the largest spectrum
    of samples, tissues and diseases reported to date constitute a baseline for developing
    higher-resolution DNA methylation maps, and provide important clues concerning
    the contribution of CpG methylation to tissue identity and its changes in the
    most prevalent human diseases.

  title: DNA methylation analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell collected
    in the AIRWAVE study
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Markers of biological ageing have potential utility in primary care and
    public health. We developed a model of age based on untargeted metabolic profiling
    across multiple platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
    liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in urine and serum, within a large sample
    (N=2,239) from the UK Airwave cohort. We validated a subset of model predictors
    in a Finnish cohort including repeat measurements from 2,144 individuals. DNA
    methylation age was assessed for 1,110 participants using the Infinium HumanMethylation
    EPIC BeadChip. We investigated the determinants of accelerated ageing, including
    lifestyle and psychological risk factors for premature mortality. The metabolomic
    age model was well correlated with chronological age (mean r=0.86 across independent
    test sets). Increased metabolomic age acceleration (mAA) was associated after
    false discovery rate (FDR) correction with overweight/obesity, diabetes, heavy
    alcohol use and depression. DNA methylation age acceleration measures were uncorrelated
    with mAA. Increased DNA methylation phenotypic age acceleration (N = 1,110) was
    associated after FDR correction with heavy alcohol use, hypertension and low income.
    In conclusion, metabolomics is a promising approach for the assessment of biological
    age and appears complementary to established epigenetic clocks.

  title: 'An integrated genetic-epigenetic analysis of schizophrenia: Evidence for
    co-localization of genetic associations and differential DNA methylation.'
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Abstract  Background: Schizophrenia is a severe, highly heritable, neuropsychiatric
    disorder characterized by episodic psychosis and altered cognitive function. Despite
    success in identifying genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, there remains
    uncertainty about the causal genes involved in disease pathogenesis and how their
    function is regulated. Insights into the functional complexity of the genome have
    focussed attention on the role of non-sequence-based genomic variation in health
    and disease. Although a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
    disease phenotypes is best achieved using an integrated functional genomics strategy,
    few studies have attempted to systematically integrate genetic and epigenetic
    epidemiological approaches.    Results: We performed a multi-stage epigenome-wide
    association study (EWAS), quantifying genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation
    in a total of 1,801 individuals from three independent sample cohorts. We identified
    multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and region (DMRs) associated
    with schizophrenia, independently of important confounders such as smoking, with
    consistent effects across the three independent cohorts. We also show that polygenic
    burden for schizophrenia is associated with epigenetic variation at multiple loci
    across the genome, independently of loci implicated in the analysis of diagnosed
    schizophrenia. Finally, we show how DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)
    analyses can be used to annotate the extended genomic regions nominated by genetic
    studies of schizophrenia, with Bayesian co-localization analyses highlighting
    potential regulatory variation causally involved in disease.     Conclusion: This
    study represents the first systematic integrated analysis of genetic and epigenetic
    variation in schizophrenia, introducing a methodological pipeline that can be
    used to inform EWAS analyses of other complex traits and diseases. We demonstrate
    the utility of using polygenic risk score (PRS) for identifying molecular variation
    associated with etiological variation, and mQTLs for refining the functional/regulatory
    variation associated with schizophrenia risk variants. Finally, we present strong
    evidence for the co-localization of genetic associations for schizophrenia and
    differential DNA methylation.'

  title: 'An integrated genetic-epigenetic analysis of schizophrenia: Evidence for
    co-localization of genetic associations and differential DNA methylation'
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: Schizophrenia is a severe, highly heritable, neuropsychiatric
    disorder characterized by episodic psychosis and altered cognitive function. Despite
    success in identifying genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, there remains
    uncertainty about the causal genes involved in disease pathogenesis and how their
    function is regulated. Insights into the functional complexity of the genome have
    focussed attention on the role of non-sequence-based genomic variation in health
    and disease. Although a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
    disease phenotypes is best achieved using an integrated functional genomics strategy,
    few studies have attempted to systematically integrate genetic and epigenetic
    epidemiological approaches.Results: We performed a multi-stage epigenome-wide
    association study (EWAS), quantifying genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation
    in a total of 1,801 individuals from three independent sample cohorts. We identified
    multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and region (DMRs) associated
    with schizophrenia, independently of important confounders such as smoking, with
    consistent effects across the three independent cohorts. We also show that polygenic
    burden for schizophrenia is associated with epigenetic variation at multiple loci
    across the genome, independently of loci implicated in the analysis of diagnosed
    schizophrenia. Finally, we show how DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)
    analyses can be used to annotate the extended genomic regions nominated by genetic
    studies of schizophrenia, with Bayesian co-localization analyses highlighting
    potential regulatory variation causally involved in disease.Conclusion: This study
    represents the first systematic integrated analysis of genetic and epigenetic
    variation in schizophrenia, introducing a methodological pipeline that can be
    used to inform EWAS analyses of other complex traits and diseases. We demonstrate
    the utility of using polygenic risk score (PRS) for identifying molecular variation
    associated with etiological variation, and mQTLs for refining the functional/regulatory
    variation associated with schizophrenia risk variants. Finally, we present strong
    evidence for the co-localization of genetic associations for schizophrenia and
    differential DNA methylation.'

  title: DNA methylation in blood from neonatal screening cards and the association
    with BMI and insulin sensitivity in early childhood
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "There is increasing evidence that metabolic diseases originate in early\
    \ life, and epigenetic changes have been implicated as key drivers of this early\
    \ life programming. This led to the hypothesis that epigenetic marks present at\
    \ birth may predict an individual\u2019s future risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\
    \ In this study, we assessed whether epigenetic marks in blood of newborn children\
    \ were associated with BMI and insulin sensitivity later in childhood.DNA methylation\
    \ was measured in neonatal blood spot samples of 439 children using the Illumina\
    \ Infinium 450k BeadChip. Associations were assessed between DNA methylation at\
    \ birth and BMI z-scores, body fat mass, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR\
    \ at age 5 years, as well as birthweight, maternal BMI and smoking status.No individual\
    \ methylation sites at birth were associated with obesity or insulin sensitivity\
    \ measures at 5 years. DNA methylation in 69 genomic regions at birth was associated\
    \ with BMI z-scores at age 5 years, and in 63 regions with HOMA-IR. The methylation\
    \ changes were generally small (<5%), except for a region near the non-coding\
    \ RNA nc886 (VTRNA2-1) where a clear link between methylation status at birth\
    \ and BMI in childhood was observed (P=0.001). Associations were also found between\
    \ DNA methylation, maternal smoking, and birth weight.We identified a number of\
    \ DNA methylation regions at birth that were associated with obesity or insulin\
    \ sensitivity measurements in childhood. These findings support the mounting evidence\
    \ on the role of epigenetics in programming of metabolic health. Whether many\
    \ of these small changes in DNA methylation are causally related to the health\
    \ outcomes, and of clinical relevance, remains to be determined, but the nc886\
    \ region represents a promising obesity risk marker that warrants further investigation."

  title: Abundant Quantitative Trait Loci for CpG Methylation and Expression Across
    Human Brain Tissues
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: A fundamental challenge in the post-genome era is to understand and annotate
    the consequences of genetic variation, particularly within the context of human
    tissues. We describe a set of integrated experiments designed to investigate the
    effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation, mRNA expression and
    microRNA (miRNA) expression in four distinct human brain regions. We show that
    brain tissues may be readily distinguished based on methylation status or expression
    profile. We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation mRNA expression and show
    for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation. We
    observe that the largest magnitude effects occur across distinct brain regions.
    We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will be useful in
    understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.Authorized Access data:Mapping

  summary: We report DNA methylation profiling on 565 meningiomas integrated with
    genetic, transcriptomic, biochemical, proteomic, and single-cell approaches to
    show meningiomas are comprised of 3 groups with distinct clinical outcomes, biological
    drivers, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Merlin-intact meningiomas have the best
    outcomes and are distinguished by NF2/Merlin regulation of glucocorticoid signaling,
    apoptosis, and susceptibility to cytotoxic therapy. Immune-enriched meningiomas
    have intermediate outcomes and are distinguished by immune infiltration, HLA expression,
    and lymphatic vessels. Hypermitotic meningiomas have the worst outcomes and are
    distinguished by convergent genetic and epigenetic mechanisms driving the cell
    cycle and resistance to cytotoxic therapy. Our results establish a framework for
    understanding meningioma biology, and provide a foundation for new meningioma
    treatments.

  title: Functional Validation of Common Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Genetic Risk
    Variants [850k methylation arrays]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Rationale: To identify functionally relevant common genetic risk variants
    associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we performed expression quantitative
    trait loci (eQTL) and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping, followed
    by co-localization of eQTL and mQTL with genetic association signals as well as
    mediation analysis.Methods: Illumina MEGA genotyping arrays, mRNA sequencing,
    and Illumina 850k methylation arrays were performed on lung tissue of participants
    with IPF (234 RNA and 345 DNA samples) and non-diseased control (188 RNA and 202
    DNA samples). Transcriptome and methylome datasets were normalized for unknown
    batch effects using Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER). eQTL,
    cell type-interaction eQTL, and mQTL analyses were performed in FastQTL and co-localization
    analysis in eCAVIAR separately for cases and controls.  Benjamini-Hochberg false
    discovery rate was used for adjustment for multiple comparisons.Results: After
    appropriate adjustment, we identified 4,745 genes with significant eQTLs in controls
    and 6,047 in cases (FDR-adjusted p<0.05). Focusing on genetic variants within
    10 primary IPF-associated genetic loci, we identified 27 eQTLs in controls and
    24 eQTLs in cases (FDR-adjusted p<0.05). Among these signals, we identified association
    of rs35705950 with expression of MUC5B (Chr11 locus) and rs2076295 with expression
    of DSP (Chr6 locus) in both cases and controls. To address cell specificity, we
    performed cell type-interaction eQTL analysis and identified an association of
    rs2076295 with expression of DSP in smooth muscle cells. mQTL analysis identified
    CpGs in gene bodies of MUC5B (cg17589883) and DSP (cg08964675) associated with
    the lead variants in these two loci. eCAVIAR demonstrated strong co-localization
    of eQTL/mQTL and genetic signal in MUC5B (rs35705950) and DSP (rs2076295) in both
    cases and controls. Mediation analysis demonstrated partial mediation of the effect
    of common variants in MUC5B and DSP loci on disease risk though MUC5B and DSP
    gene expression. Functional validation of the mQTL in MUC5B demonstrates that
    the CpG is within a putative internal repressor element that interacts through
    a 3D loop with the enhancer containing the rs35705950 genetic variant.Conclusions:
    Using lung eQTL/mQTL, co-localization, and mediation analyses, we have established
    the functional validation of the common IPF genetic risk variants for MUC5B (rs35705950)
    and DSP (rs2076295). These results provide additional evidence that both MUC5B
    and DSP are involved in the etiology of IPF.'

  title: Genome-wide association studies identify novel genetic loci for epigenetic
    age acceleration among survivors of childhood cancer [Metadata_SJLIFE2_502]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: Increased epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in survivors of\
    \ childhood cancer is associated with specific treatment exposures, unfavorable\
    \ health behaviors, and presence of certain chronic health conditions. To better\
    \ understand inter-individual variability, we investigated the genetic basis underlying\
    \ EAA.  Methods: Genome-wide association studies of EAA based on multiple epigenetic\
    \ clocks (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) were performed. MethylationEPIC\
    \ BeadChip array and whole-genome sequencing data were generated with blood-derived\
    \ DNA from participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (discovery: 2,138\
    \ pre-existing and 502 newly generated data, all survivors; exploratory: 282 community\
    \ controls). Linear regression models were fit for each epigenetic age against\
    \ allelic dose of each genetic variant, adjusting for age at sampling, sex, and\
    \ cancer treatment exposures. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine\
    \ summary statistics from two discovery data sets. LD (Linkage disequilibrium)\
    \ score regression was used to estimate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based\
    \ heritability.  Results:  For EAA-Horvath, a genome-wide significant association\
    \ was mapped to SELP gene with the strongest SNP rs732314 (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.57,\
    \ P=3.30\xD710-11). Moreover, the stratified analysis of the association between\
    \ rs732314 and EAA-Horvath showed substantial heterogeneity between children and\
    \ adults (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.97 vs. 0.51, I2=73.1%) as well as between survivors\
    \ with and without chest/abdominal/pelvic-RT exposure (\u03B2=0.64 vs. 0.31, I2=66.3%).\
    \ For EAA-Hannum, an association was mapped to HLA locus with the strongest SNP\
    \ rs28366133 (meta-GWAS: \u03B2=0.78, P=3.78\xD710-11). There was no genome-wide\
    \ significant hit for EAA-PhenoAge or EAA-GrimAge. Interestingly, among community\
    \ controls, rs732314 was associated with EAA-Horvath (\u03B2=1.09, P=5.43\xD7\
    10-5), whereas rs28366133 was not associated with EAA-Hannum (\u03B2=0.21, P=0.49).\
    \ The estimated heritability was 0.33 (SE=0.20) for EAA-Horvath and 0.17 (SE=0.23)\
    \ for EAA-Hannum, but close to zero for EAA-PhenoAge and EAA-GrimAge.  Conclusions:\
    \ We identified novel genetic variants in SELP gene and HLA region associated\
    \ with EAA-Horvath and EAA-Hannum, respectively, among survivors of childhood\
    \ cancer. The new genetic variants in combination with other replicated known\
    \ variants can facilitate identification of survivors at higher risk in developing\
    \ accelerated aging, and potentially inform drug targets for future intervention\
    \ strategies among vulnerable survivors."

  summary: Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to periodontal disease,
    but the underlying susceptibility pathways are not fully understood. Epigenetic
    mechanisms are malleable regulators of gene function that can change in response
    to genetic and environmental stimuli, thereby providing a potential mechanism
    mediating risk effects in periodontitis. The aim of this study is to identify
    epigenetic changes across tissues that are associated with periodontal disease.

  title: The CURELUNG Project from the Epigenetics Side (Patients dataset)
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a very common solid tumor where only
    small advances in the reduction of relapse-free survival and overall survival
    have been accomplished. The issue is particularly critical for stage I patients
    where there are not available biomarkers, in the absence of detectable nodal or
    other metastatic involvement, that might indicate which high-risk patients should
    receive the beneficially proved adjuvant chemotherapy. We aimed to find DNA methylation
    markers with prognostic value that could be helpful in this regard and complement
    the conventional staging. A DNA methylation microarray that analyzes 450,000 CpG
    sites in the human genome was used to study primary tumoral DNA obtained from
    a multicenter cohort of 490 patients with NSCLC, corresponding to 339 adenocarcinomas,
    133 squamous carcinomas and 18 large cell carcinomas, in addition to 25 normal
    lung epithelium samples. The obtained prognostic DNA methylation markers were
    validated by the development of a single methylation-pyrosequencing assay in an
    independent cohort of 143 patients with stage I NSCLC. The unsupervised clustering
    of the studied primary NSCLC distinguished two branches with distinct clinical
    outcomes. Those CpG sites that were the best predictors of recurrence in stage
    I NSCLC patients were further confirmed in the described independent cohort. Both
    the global DNA methylation classifier and the highly-ranked aberrantly methylated
    single genes improved prognostic accuracy beyond standard stagings.

    \ of Intestinal Inflammation"
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Crohn\u2019s disease is a relapsing inflammatory disorder with a variable\
    \ clinical course. While most patients present with purely an inflammatory phenotype\
    \ (B1) at diagnosis, a subgroup (~20%) rapidly progresses to complicated disease\
    \ manifestations that include stricturing (B2) within 5 years. DNA methylation\
    \ is a key epigenetic mechanism that can regulate gene expression and thereby\
    \ influence the development and progression of complex diseases. Site-specific\
    \ DNA methylation differences have been reported in peripheral blood of patients\
    \ with Crohn\u2019s disease, but investigation of the temporal relationship between\
    \ methylation and disease is required to establish whether the methylome plays\
    \ a causal role and can be leveraged for therapeutic benefits. To this end, we\
    \ conducted an epigenome-wide study of methylation (~850K sites) in peripheral\
    \ blood at diagnosis and during follow-up from the RISK pediatric Crohn\u2019\
    s disease inception cohort. While some methylation changes associated with Crohn\u2019\
    s disease might be causal, in peripheral blood the vast majority are found to\
    \ be a transient consequence of inflammation and thus a symptom of disease."

  summary: We measured the DNA methylation levels at ~800,000 CpG sites from ethnically
    admixed children in CBMCs at birth and PBMCs age 7 to study the longitudinal dynamics
    of methylation marks. We found that self-reported race-dependent methylation levels
    were conserved over time, which helped to suggest that blood methylation levels

  title: Integrative Epigenome-Wide Analysis Shows That DNA Methylation May Mediate
    Genetic Risk In Inflammatory Bowel Disease [Whole blood, Methylation profiling]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Epigenetic alterations may provide important insights into gene-environment
    interaction in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we observe  epigenome-wide
    DNA methylation differences in 240 newly-diagnosed IBD cases and 190 controls.
    These include 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 5 differentially
    methylated regions (DMRs), which we study in detail using whole genome bisulphite
    sequencing. We replicate the top DMP (RPS6KA2) and DMRs (VMP1, ITGB2, TXK) in
    an independent cohort.Using paired genetic and epigenetic data, we delineate methylation
    quantitative trait loci; VMP1/microRNA-21 methylation associates with two genetic
    polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD susceptibility variant.
    Separated cell data highlight the cell type of origin of epigenetic signals seen
    in whole blood; IBD-associated hypermethylation within the TXK gene transcription
    start-sitepromoter region negatively correlates with gene expression in whole
    blood and CD8+ T-cells, but not other cell types. Thus, site-specific DNA methylation
    changes in IBD are relatedrelate to underlying genotype and associate with cell-specific
    alteration in gene expression.

  title: Edematous Severe Acute Malnutrition is Characterized by Hypomethylation of
    DNA
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: A slower transmethylation of one-carbon substrates in the edematous form
    of severe acute malnutrition (ESAM) suggests that downstream aberrations in DNA
    methylation could drive differences in acute pathogenesis between ESAM and non-edematous
    malnutrition (NESAM). Here, we integrate genome-wide assessments of DNA methylation
    with corresponding gene expression profiles and sequence variation to show that
    relative to NESAM, acute ESAM is characterized by significant hypomethylation
    at 99% of differentially methylated loci in two SAM cohorts, whereas recovered
    adults show no significant differences in methylation. Hypomethylated loci correlate
    with both up- and down-regulation of proximal genes, which are associated with
    the clinical sub-phenotypes of kwashiorkor and enriched for GWAS hits linked to
    over-nutrition, including fatty liver and diabetes. Methylation at these loci
    also appears to be influenced by nearby genetic variation in a manner that varies
    with nutritional status. Our findings implicate epigenetic and genetic variation
    in ESAM pathophysiology and support methyl-group supplementation in ESAM management.

  title: Many obesity-associated SNPs strongly associate with DNA methylation changes
    at proximal promoters and enhancers
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: The mechanisms of how genetic variants (SNPs) identified in
    genome-wide association studies act to influence body mass remain unknown for
    most of these SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent
    evidence points to epigenetic and chromatin state of the genome to have an important
    role.  Methods: 355 healthy young individuals were genotyped for 52 known obesity-associated
    SNPs and we obtained DNA methylation levels in their blood using the Illumina
    450K BeadChip. Associations between alleles and methylation at proximal cytosine
    residues were tested using a linear model adjusted for age, sex, weight category
    and a proxy for blood cell type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used
    two open-access datasets (skin fibroblasts, n=62; four brain regions, n=121-133)
    and an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n=149).  Results:
    We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs associate with methylation
    levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107 CpG sites, 38 are located in gene
    promoters, including genes strongly implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1,
    NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1, HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5,
    SIX5, AGRN, IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
    SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1,SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27). Interestingly,
    the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these genes. We also found
    that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
    Finally, our results indicate that some of these associations are not blood-specific
    as we successfully replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.  Conclusions:
    Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated SNPs are associated
    with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected by association of obesity risk
    allele genotypes with differential DNA methylation. This study highlights the
    importance of DNA methylation and other chromatin marks as a way to understand
    the molecular basis of genetic variants associated to human diseases and traits.'

    variation, such as DNA methylation, is a likely mechanistic candidate as DNA methylation
    is sensitive to environmental insults and can regulate long-term changes in gene

    to investigate the effects of maternal stress on DNA methylation in mothers and
    newborns. We used four measures of maternal stress to capture a range of stressful
    experiences: general trauma, sexual trauma, war trauma, and chronic stress. We
    identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with general
    trauma, sexual trauma, and war trauma in both mothers and newborns. No DMPs were
    associated with chronic stress. Sexual trauma was positively associated with epigenetic
    age acceleration across several epigenetic clocks in mothers. General trauma and
    war trauma were positively associated with newborn epigenetic age acceleration
    using the extrinsic epigenetic age clock. We tested the top DMPs for enrichment
    of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) and found no enrichment in mothers. In newborns,
    top DMPs associated with war trauma were enriched for DHS in embryonic and fetal
    cell types. Finally, one of the top DMPs associated with war trauma in newborns
    also predicted birthweight, completing the cycle from maternal stress to DNA methylation
    to newborn health outcome. Our results indicate that maternal stress is associated
    with site-specific changes in DNAm and epigenetic age acceleration in both mothers

  summary: 'We hypothesized that DNA methylation distributes into specific patterns
    in cancer cells, which reflect critical biological differences. We therefore examined
    the methylation profiles of 344 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clustering
    of these patients by methylation data segregated patients into 16 groups. Five
    of these groups defined new AML subtypes that shared no other known feature. In
    addition, DNA methylation profiles segregated patients with CEBPA aberrations
    from other subtypes of leukemia, defined four epigenetically distinct forms of
    AML with NPM1 mutations, and showed that established AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11 and
    PML-RARA leukemia entities are associated with specific methylation profiles.
    We report a 15-gene methylation classifier predictive of overall survival in an
    independent patient cohort (p<0.001, adjusted for known covariates).Keywords:

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a complex age-related neurodegenerative\
    \ disorder that likely involves epigenetic  factors. To better understand the\
    \ epigenetic state associated with AD, we surveyed 420,852 DNA methylation (DNAm)\
    \ sites  from neurotypical controls (N = 49) and late-onset AD patients (N = 24)\
    \ across four brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal  cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal\
    \ cortex and cerebellum). We identiied 858 sites with robust diferential methylation\
    \ collectively  annotated to 772 possible genes (FDR < 5%, within 10 kb). These\
    \ sites were overrepresented in AD genetic risk loci  (p = 0.00655) and were enriched\
    \ for changes during normal aging (p < 2.2 \xD7 10\u221216), and nearby genes\
    \ were enriched for  processes related to cell-adhesion, immunity, and calcium\
    \ homeostasis (FDR < 5%). To functionally validate these associations,  we generated\
    \ and analyzed corresponding transcriptome data to prioritize 130 genes within\
    \ 10 kb of the diferentially  methylated sites. These 130 genes were diferentially\
    \ expressed between AD cases and controls and their expression was  associated\
    \ with nearby DNAm (p < 0.05). This integrated analysis implicates novel genes\
    \ in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, such as  ANKRD30B. These results highlight DNAm\
    \ diferences in Alzheimer\u2019s disease that have gene expression correlates,\
    \ further  implicating DNAm as an epigenetic mechanism underlying pathological\
    \ molecular changes associated with AD. Furthermore,  our framework illustrates\

  title: The PedBE clock estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [dataset
    10, MAVAN II]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused
    on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological
    age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults,
    deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with
    several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however,
    fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more
    dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. To address this crucial
    gap, we aimed to develop a highly accurate, noninvasive biological measure age
    specific to pediatric samples by using buccal epithelial cell DNAm. We gathered
    1,721 genome-wide DNAm profiles from 11 different cohorts of typically developing
    individuals aged 0 to 20 y old. Elastic net penalized regression was used to select
    94 CpG sites from a training dataset (n = 1,032) and the performance was assessed
    in a separate dataset (n = 689). The DNAm at 94 CpG sites was highly predictive
    of age in the test cohorts (median absolute error = 0.35 y). The Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic
    (PedBE) clock was characterized in additional cohorts, showcasing the accuracy
    in longitudinal data, the performance in nonbuccal tissues and adult age ranges,
    and the association with obstetric outcomes. The PedBE tool for measuring biological
    age in children might help in understanding the environmental and contextual factors
    that shape the DNA methylome during child development, and how it, in turn, might
    relate to child health and disease.

    age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults,
    deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with
    several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however,
    fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more
    dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. To address this crucial
    gap, we aimed to develop a highly accurate, noninvasive biological measure age
    specific to pediatric samples by using buccal epithelial cell DNAm. We gathered
    1,721 genome-wide DNAm profiles from 11 different cohorts of typically developing
    individuals aged 0 to 20 y old. Elastic net penalized regression was used to select
    94 CpG sites from a training dataset (n = 1,032) and the performance was assessed
    in a separate dataset (n = 689). The DNAm at 94 CpG sites was highly predictive
    of age in the test cohorts (median absolute error = 0.35 y). The Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic
    (PedBE) clock was characterized in additional cohorts, showcasing the accuracy
    in longitudinal data, the performance in nonbuccal tissues and adult age ranges,
    and the association with obstetric outcomes. The PedBE tool for measuring biological
    age in children might help in understanding the environmental and contextual factors
    that shape the DNA methylome during child development, and how it, in turn, might
    relate to child health and disease.

  title: Distinctions between sex and time in patterns of DNA methylation across puberty
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: There are significant sex differences in human physiology
    and disease; the genomic sources of these differences, however, are not well understood.
    During puberty, a drastic neuroendocrine shift signals physical changes resulting
    in robust sex differences in human physiology. Here, we explore how shifting patterns
    of DNA methylation may inform these pathways of biological plasticity during the
    pubertal transition.   Methods: In this study we analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm)
    in saliva at two time points across the pubertal transition within the same individuals.
    We targeted two domains of DNAm patterns that may inform processes of sexual differentiation
    1) sex related sites, which demonstrated differences between males from females
    and 2) time related sites in which DNAm shifted significantly between timepoints.
    We further explored the correlated network structure sex and time related DNAm
    networks and linked these patterns to pubertal stage, assays of salivary testosterone,
    a reliable diagnostic of free, unbound hormone that is available to act on target
    tissues, and overlap with androgen response elements.  Results: Sites that differed
    by biological sex were largely independent of sites that underwent change across
    puberty. Time-related DNAm sites, but not sex-related sites, formed correlated
    networks that were associated with pubertal stage. Both time and sex DNAm networks
    reflected salivary testosterone levels that were enriched for androgen response
    elements, with sex-related DNAm networks being informative of testosterone levels
    above and beyond biological sex later in the pubertal transition.   Conclusions:
    These results inform our understanding of the distinction between sex- and time-related
    differences in DNAm during the critical period of puberty and highlight a novel
    linkage between correlated patterns of sex-related DNAm and levels of salivary
    testosterone.'

  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and
    treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated
    regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from
    each other. We therefore hypothesized that these colon cDMRs might also be cDMRs
    for other cancer types. For colon, lung, breast, thyroid, and Wilms tumors, we
    show stochastic variation in methylation within each tumor type, but involving
    the same loci across tumor types, with intermediate values of variation for premalignant
    adenomas.

  title: Implications of epigenetic drift in colorectal neoplasia
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Many normal tissues undergo age-related DNA methylation drift  providing
    a quantitative measure of tissue age. However  this drift has not been demonstrated
    in neoplastic tissues. Here we identify and validate 781 CpG-islands (CGIs) that
    undergo significant methylomic drift in normal colorectal tissues  continue to
    drift in neoplasia and remain significantly correlated with one another across
    tissue samples. However  compared with normal colon  this drift advances (~3-4
    fold) faster in neoplasia consistent with increased cell proliferation during
    neoplastic progression. Furthermore  we show that the observed drift patterns
    are broadly consistent with modeled adenoma-carcinoma sojourn time distributions
    from colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence data. These results support the hypothesis
    that  beginning with the founder premalignant cell  cancer precursors frequently
    sojourn for decades before turning into cancer which implies that the founder
    cell typically arises early in life. We estimate that at least 77-89% of the observed
    drift variance in distal and rectal tumors is explained by stochastic variability
    associated with neoplastic progression  while only 55% of the variance is explained
    for proximal tumors. However  >50%  of identified gene-CGI pairs in the proximal
    colon that undergo drift are significantly and mainly negatively correlated with
    cancer gene expression  suggesting that methylomic drift participates in the clonal
    evolution of CRCs.  Significance:  Methylomic drift advances in colorectal neoplasia
    consistent with extended sojourn time distributions explaining a significant fraction
    of epigenetic heterogeneity in CRCs. Importantly  the estimated long-duration
    premalignant sojourn times suggest that early dietary and lifestyle interventions
    may be more effective than later changes in reducing CRC incidence.'

  title: Stable methylation loci are associated with systolic blood pressure in a
    Croatian island population
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Adriatic islanders have a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome that is
    not fully explained by previous behavioral, dietary, and genetic studies. Some
    DNA methylation remains stable and may be established in early life, whereas others
    are dynamic and may vary over time in response to different conditions. The objective
    of the present study was to identify stable and dynamic DNA methylation loci associated
    with cardiometabolic traits among the populations from the island of Hvar, the
    largest island in the eastern Adriatic coast. An epigenome-wide association study
    (EWAS) was conducted using peripheral blood that was longitudinally collected
    at two time points, 10 years apart. DNA methylation was analyzed via Infinium
    MethylationEPIC BeadArray. Stable and dynamic loci were identified using linear
    mixed models. A total of 43,041 loci were classified as stable, while 45,769 loci
    were classified as dynamic. Associations between various cardiometabolic traits
    and stable and dynamic methylation loci were respectively assessed using linear
    mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status. After adjustment
    for false-discovery rate, 24 CpG loci were significantly associated with systolic
    blood pressure (Q < 0.1), of which 22 were stable loci and 2 were dynamic loci;
    while 12/22 (55%) of the systolic blood-pressure-associated stable loci resided
    in a gene promoter. Additionally, there was one stable locus associated with serum
    calcium and one with C-reactive protein. The results suggest that multiple genes
    involved in the determination of systolic blood pressure may be regulated via
    epigenetic programming established in early life.

  title: Altered DNA methylation profiles in blood from patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
    disease
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Prion diseases are fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative disorders\
    \ caused by the misfolding and aggregation of prion protein. Although recent studies\
    \ have implicated epigenetic variation in common neurodegenerative disorders,\
    \ no study has yet explored their role in human prion diseases. Here we profiled\
    \ genome-wide blood DNA methylation in the most common human prion disease, sporadic\
    \ Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Our case-control study (n=219), when accounting\
    \ for differences in cell type composition between individuals, identified 38\
    \ probes at genome-wide significance (p\u2009<\u20091.24x10-7). Nine of these\
    \ sites were taken forward in a replication study, performed in an independent\
    \ case-control (n=186) cohort using pyrosequencing. Sites in or close to FKBP5,\
    \ AIM2 (2 probes), UHRF1, KCNAB2, PRNP, ANK1 successfully replicated. The blood-based\
    \ DNA methylation signal was tissue- and disease-specific, in that the replicated\
    \ probe signals were unchanged in case-control studies using sCJD frontal-cortex\
    \ (n=84), blood samples from patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and from\
    \ inherited and acquired prion diseases. Machine learning algorithms using blood\
    \ DNA methylation array profiles accurately distinguished sCJD patients and controls.\
    \ Finally, we identified sites whose methylation levels associated with prolonged\
    \ survival in sCJD patients. Altogether, this study has identified a peripheral\
    \ DNA methylation signature of sCJD with a variety of potential biomarker applications."

  title: DNA methylation signature of human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading preventable cause of behavioural\
    \ and cognitive deficits, which may affect between 2-5% of children in North America.\
    \ While the underlying mechanisms of alcohol\u2019s effects on development remain\
    \ relatively unknown, emerging evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms in mediating\
    \ the range of symptoms observed in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder\
    \ (FASD). Thus, we investigated the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on genome-wide\
    \ DNA methylation in the NeuroDevNet FASD cohort, the largest cohort of human\
    \ FASD samples to date. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of buccal epithelial\
    \ cells were analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array on a Canadian\
    \ cohort of 206 children (110 FASD and 96 controls). Genotyping was performed\
    \ in parallel using the Infinium HumanOmni2.5-Quad v1.0 BeadChip. After correcting\
    \ for the effects of genetic background, 658 significantly differentially methylated\
    \ sites between FASD cases and controls remained, with 41 displaying differences\
    \ in beta greater than 5%. Furthermore, 203 differentially methylated regions\
    \ containing 2 or more CpGs were also identified, overlapping with 167 different\
    \ genes. The majority of differentially methylated genes were highly expressed\
    \ in samples from the Allen Brain Atlas, which showed high correlations with buccal\
    \ cell DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, over-representation analysis of\
    \ the up-methylated genes displayed a significant enrichment for neurodevelopmental\
    \ processes and diseases, such as anxiety, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders.\
    \ These findings suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with distinct\
    \ DNA methylation patterns in children and adolescents, raising the possibility\
    \ of an epigenetic biomarker of FASD."

  title: DNA methylation and inflammation marker profiles associated with a history
    of depression.
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Depression is a common and disabling disorder, representing a major social\
    \ and economic health issue. Moreover, depression is associated with the progression\
    \ of diseases with an inflammatory etiology including many inflammatory-related\
    \ disorders. At the molecular level, the mechanisms by which depression might\
    \ promote the onset of these diseases and associated immune-dysfunction are not\
    \ well understood. In this study we assessed genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation\
    \ in whole blood-derived DNA obtained from individuals with a self-reported history\
    \ of depression (n=100) and individuals without a history of depression (n=100)\
    \ using the Illumina 450K microarray. Our analysis identified 6 significant (Sidak\
    \ corrected\_P < 0.05) depression-associated differentially methylated regions\
    \ (DMRs); the top-ranked DMR was located in exon 1 of the LTB4R2 gene (Sidak corrected\
    \ P = 1.27 x 10-14). Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression were generated\
    \ and known biological markers of inflammation, telomere length (TL) and IL-6,\
    \ were measured in DNA and serum samples respectively. Next, we employed a systems-level\
    \ approach to identify networks of co-methylated loci associated with a history\
    \ of depression, in addition to depression PRS, TL and IL-6 levels. Our analysis\
    \ identified one depression-associated co-methylation module (P = 0.04). Interestingly,\
    \ the depression-associated module was highly enriched for pathways related to\
    \ immune function and was also associated with TL and IL-6 cytokine levels. In\
    \ summary, our genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of individuals with and without\
    \ a self-reported history of depression identified several candidate DMRs of potential\
    \ relevance to the pathogenesis of depression and its associated immune-dysfunction\
    \ phenotype."

  title: Longitudinal DNA methylation differences precede type 1 diabetes
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation may be involved in development of type 1 diabetes (T1D),
    but previous epigenome-wide association studies were conducted among cases with
    clinically diagnosed diabetes. Using multiple pre-disease peripheral blood samples
    on the Illumina 450K and EPIC platforms, we investigated longitudinal methylation
    differences between 87 T1D cases and 87 controls from the prospective Diabetes
    Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) cohort. Change in methylation with age
    differed between cases and controls in 10 regions. Average longitudinal methylation
    differed between cases and controls at two genomic positions and 28 regions. Some
    methylation differences were detectable and consistent as early as birth, including
    before and after the onset of preclinical islet autoimmunity. Results map to transcription
    factors, other protein coding genes, and non-coding regions of the genome with
    regulatory potential. The identification of methylation differences that predate
    islet autoimmunity and clinical diagnosis may suggest a role for epigenetics in
    T1D pathogenesis.

  title: Temporal Genomics Mechanisms Underlying Disease and Aging [DNA Methylation]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Given the salient role of early-life adversity and the resulting biological
    embedding in disease risk, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms
    operating at multiple levels of analysis in order to promote effective clinical
    treatments and intervention efforts for survivors. An example for such an effort
    could be to utilize models of dynamic cellular markers as individual-level factors
    to account for variation in intervention response and clinical outcomes. Results
    of this study will lead to new knowledge about specific gene expression pathways
    in response to stress, and whether the response is moderated by previous exposure
    to early adversity, shorter telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) and self-report
    mental-health measures. Thus, the long-term effects of this study will advance
    our understanding on stress-related transcriptomic changes that play a downstream
    role in disease susceptibility and accelerated aging, with the goal of targeting
    specific pathways and genes for potential intervention studies and pharmacological
    treatments to reverse the effects of exposure to early adversity. For example,
    considering high failure rates for depression treatments, and in order to tailor
    individual interventions, identifying objective changes in stress-induced gene
    expression may help to predict intervention efficacy in clinical and non-clinical
    settings, as seen, for example, in breast and leukemia cancers. Thus, findings
    will have a range of impacts for basic science, intervention studies and clinical
    practice that will influence treatments to match the specific cellular processes
    operating within an individual.

  title: Cell-free DNA modification dynamics in abiraterone acetate-treated prostate
    cancer patients
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Purpose: Primary resistance to abiraterone acetate (AA), a key medication
    for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, occurs in
    20-40% of the patients. We aim to identify predictive biomarkers for AA-treatment
    response and understand the mechanisms related to treatment resistance.Experimental
    Design: We used the Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip to monitor modification
    profiles of cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) in 108 plasma samples collected
    from 33 AA-treated patients. Results: Thirty cytosines showed significant modification
    differences (FDR q < 0.05) between the AA-sensitive and AA-resistant patients
    during the treatment, of which 21 cytosines were differentially modified prior
    to treatment. In addition, the AA-sensitive patients, but not AA-resistant patients,
    lost interindividual variation of cfDNA modification shortly after starting AA-treatment,
    but such variation returned to initial levels in the later phases of treatment.
    Conclusions: Our findings provide a list of potential biomarkers for prediction
    of AA-treatment response, highlight the prognostic value of using cytosine modification
    variance as biomarkers, and shed new insights into the mechanisms of prostate
    cancer relapse in AA-sensitive patients.'

  title: Radiomic subtyping improves disease stratification beyond key molecular,

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: To analyze the potential of radiomics for disease stratification\
    \ beyond key molecular, clinical and standard imaging features in patients with\
    \ glioblastoma.Methods: Quantitative imaging features (n=1043) were extracted\
    \ from the multiparametric MRI of 181 patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma\
    \ prior to standard-of-care treatment (allocated to a discovery and validation\
    \ set, 2:1 ratio). A subset of 386/1043 features were identified as reproducible\
    \ (in an independent MRI-test-retest cohort) and selected for analysis. A penalized\
    \ Cox-model with 10-fold cross-validation (Coxnet) was fitted on the discovery\
    \ set to construct a radiomic signature for predicting progression-free and overall\
    \ survival (PFS, OS). The incremental value of a radiomic signature beyond molecular\
    \ (MGMT-promoter methylation, DNA-methylation subgroups), clinical (patients age,\
    \ KPS, extent-of-resection, adjuvant treatment) and standard imaging parameters\
    \ (tumor volumes) for stratifying PFS and OS was assessed with multivariate Cox-models\
    \ (performance quantified with prediction error curves).Results: The radiomic\
    \ signature (constructed from 8/386 features identified through Coxnet) increased\
    \ the prediction accuracy for PFS and OS (in both discovery and validation set)\
    \ beyond the assessed molecular, clinical and standard imaging parameters (p\u2264\
    0.01). Prediction errors decreased by 36% for PFS and 37% for OS when adding the\
    \ radiomic signature (as compared to 29% and 27% with molecular + clinical features\
    \ alone). The radiomic signature was - along with MGMT-status - the only parameter\
    \ with independent significance on multivariate analysis (p\u22640.01).Conclusions:\
    \ Our study stresses the role of integrating radiomics into a multi-layer decision\
    \ framework with key molecular and clinical features to improve disease stratification\
    \ and to potentially advance personalized treatment of patients with glioblastoma."

  title: The PedBE clock estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [dataset
    7, WSFW]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily  focused
    on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool  for measuring biological
    age that shows impressive accuracy across  most tissues and age ranges. In adults,
    deviations from the DNA  methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with
    several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children,  however,
    fewer such associations have been made, possibly because  DNAm changes are more
    dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. To address this crucial
    gap, we aimed to  develop a highly accurate, noninvasive biological measure age  specific
    to pediatric samples by using buccal epithelial cell  DNAm. We gathered 1,721
    genome-wide DNAm profiles from  11 different cohorts of typically developing individuals
    aged 0 to  20 y old. Elastic net penalized regression was used to select 94  CpG
    sites from a training dataset (n = 1,032) and the performance was assessed in
    a separate dataset (n = 689). The DNAm  at 94 CpG sites was highly predictive
    of age in the test cohorts  (median absolute error = 0.35 y). The Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic
    (PedBE)  clock was characterized in additional cohorts, showcasing the accuracy
    in longitudinal data, the performance in nonbuccal tissues and  adult age ranges,
    and the association with obstetric outcomes. The  PedBE tool for measuring biological
    age in children might help in  understanding the environmental and contextual
    factors that shape  the DNA methylome during child development, and how it, in  turn,
    might relate to child health and disease.

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Early life social experiences are believed to confer persistent effects\
    \ on individual\u2019s biology and subsequent functioning and health. Using a\
    \ diverse, longitudinal community sample of 178 children, we show that three different\
    \ types of early life social experience: family income, parental education, and\
    \ family psychosocial adversity, each predict DNA methylation within buccal epithelial\
    \ cells. Each predictor was significantly associated with DNA methylation within\
    \ a unique set of genomic CpG sites, with income showing the greatest number of\
    \ associations. Findings were independently verified using pyrosequencing. Our\
    \ results provide evidence for longitudinal associations between early life social\
    \ environment and variation in DNA methylation during childhood, after adjusting\
    \ for genetic ancestry and self-reported ethnic minority status. Gene ontology\
    \ analyses of top, differentially methylated CpG sites point to genes serving\
    \ immune and developmental regulation functions, suggesting potential pathways\
    \ for the biological embedding of early life stress and its association with later\
    \ development and health."

  title: Epigenome analysis of normal colon mucosa samples
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: To investigate whether lifestyle factors modulate the stability of gene
    promoter methylation in the normal aging colonic mucosa, we performed genome-scale
    DNA methylation profiling of 178 normal colon biopsies using the Illumina Infinium
    DNA methylation assay, which assesses the DNA methylation status of 27,578 CpG
    sites located at the promoter regions of 14,495 protein-coding genes. We identified
    Aspirin use and hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) suppress, whereas a high body
    mass index (BMI) and smoking promote age-related hyermethylation. Many of these
    loci modulated by lifestyle in the healthy colon mucosa coincide with loci hypermethylated
    in colorectal cancers and down-regulated in adenomas. The data show that lifestyle
    modulates the stability of DNA methylation in the aging colonic epithelium and
    thereby impacts the rate of evolution of cancer methylomes.

  summary: "Aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression have been reported in postmortem\
    \ brain tissues of psychotic patients, but until now there has been no systematic\

  title: DNA Methylation Markers Predict Recurrence-free Interval in Triple-Negative
    Breast Cancer.
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We lack tools to risk-stratify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our
    goal was to develop molecular tools to predict disease recurrence. Methylation
    array analysis was performed on 110 samples treated by locoregional therapy obtained
    from Institutional cohorts. Discovered marker sets were then tested by Kaplan
    Meier analyses in a prospectively collected TNBC cohort of 49 samples from the
    no chemotherapy arms of IBCSG trials VIII and IX, and by logistic regression in
    a chemotherapy-treated cohort of 121 TNBCs from combined IBCSG trials and Institutional
    repositories. High methylation was associated with shorter recurrence-free interval
    in the no chemotherapy arm of the IBCSG studies, as well as in the chemotherapy-treated
    patients within the combined Institutional and IBCSG chemotherapy cohorts (100
    marker panel, P=0.002; 30 marker panel, P=0.05). Chromosome 19 sites were enriched
    among these loci. In conclusion, our hypermethylation signatures identify increased
    recurrence risk independent of whether patients receive chemotherapy.

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex multifactorial disease
    with at least 34 loci contributing to genetic susceptibility. To gain functional
    understanding of AMD genetics, we generated DNA methylation profiles of retina
    from 160 individuals including both controls and cases at distinct stages of AMD.
    With genotypes over 8 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
    cis, we identified 37,453 methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and by integrating
    transcriptome of the same samples we identified 12,505 eQTLs and 13,747 DNAm sites
    that affect gene expression (eQTMs). We then integrated the AMD-genome-wide association
    studies (GWAS) data with mQTLs and eQTLs ascertained 87 target genes that may
    contribute to AMD risk. Our studies expand the methylation landscape of retina
    and AMD leading to direct targets for biological evaluation.

  title: Epigenetic profiling and response to CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
    T-cell therapy in B-cell malignancies
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells directed against CD19 (CART19)
    are effective in relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. Not all patients
    show treatment efficacy, but little is known about the molecular factors predicting
    clinical outcome of CART19 therapy. Our objective was to determine the effect
    of epigenetic changes in CART19 cells on the clinical course of B-cell malignancy
    patients treated with adoptive therapy. We report a case series of B-cell malignancy
    patients (68 males (M) and 46 females (F); median age of 24 years (range 3-70
    years)), comprising 77 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 37 non-Hodgkin
    lymphoma (NHL) cases, who were treated with CART19 cells. Using a DNA methylation
    microarray, we determined the epigenomic changes that occur in the patient T-cells
    upon transduction of the CAR vector. We identified 984 genomic sites with differential
    DNA methylation between CAR-untransduced (UT) and CAR-transduced (TD) T-cells
    before infusion into the patient. 18 of these distinct epigenetic loci were significantly
    associated with complete response (CR). Using the sites linked to CR, the EPICART
    signature was established, which was associated with enhanced overall survival
    (OS).

  title: DNA methylation analyses of urothelial carcinoma reveal distinct epigenetic
    subtypes and an association between gene copy number and methylation status
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: We assessed DNA methylation and copy number status of 27,000 CpGs in 149
    urothelial carcinomas and integrated the findings with gene expression and mutation
    data. Methylation was associated with gene expression for 1,332 CpGs, of which
    26% showed positive correlation with expression, i.e., high methylation and high
    gene expression levels. These positively correlated CpGs were part of specific
    transcription factor binding sites, such as sites for MYC and CREBP1, or located
    in gene bodies. Furthermore, we found genes with copy number gains, low expression
    and high methylation levels, revealing an association between methylation and
    copy number levels. This phenomenon was typically observed for developmental genes,
    such as HOX genes and tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, we also identified
    genes with copy number gains, high expression and low methylation levels. This
    was for instance observed for some keratin genes. Tumor cases could be grouped
    into four subgroups, termed epitypes, by their DNA methylation profiles. One epitype
    was influenced by the presence of infiltrating immune cells, two epitypes were
    mainly composed of non-muscle invasive tumors, and the remaining epitype of muscle
    invasive tumors. The polycomb complex protein EZH2 that blocks differentiation
    in embryonic stem cells showed increased expression both at the mRNA and protein
    levels in the muscle invasive epitype, together with methylation of polycomb target
    genes and HOX genes. Our data highlights HOX gene silencing and EZH2 expression
    as mechanisms to promote a more undifferentiated and aggressive state in UC.

  title: Epigenetic blueprint identifies poor outcome and hypomethylating agent-responsive
    T-ALL subgroup
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological
    malignancy still associated with poor outcome calling for new therapeutic options.
    DNA methylation landscapes of adult T-ALL remain largely uncharacterized. Here,
    we systematically analyzed the DNA methylation profiles of normal thymic sorted
    T-cell subpopulations and 143 primary adult T-ALLs as part of French GRAALL 2003-2005
    trial. Our results indicated that T-ALL is epigenetically distinct from normal
    T-cell subpopulations and consisted of five major subtypes (C1-C5) which were
    either associating with co-occurring DNMT3A/IDH2 mutations (C1), TAL1 deregulation
    (C2), TLX3 (C3), TLX1/in cis-HOXA9 (C4) or in trans-HOXA9 (C5) overexpression.
    Importantly, our data identified an unexpected subset of hypermethylated T-ALL
    associated with poor outcome and primary therapeutic response. Using mouse xenografts,
    we showed that hypermethylated T-ALL samples displayed therapeutic response to
    the DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-Azacitidine, which significantly delayed tumor
    progression suggesting epigenetic-based therapies as a novel treatment option
    in hypermethylated T-ALL.

  title: Genetic vulnerability to DUSP22 promotor hypermethylation is involved in
    the relation between in utero famine exposure and schizophrenia (CHINFAM Data
    Set)
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Epigenetic changes may account for the doubled risk to develop schizophrenia
    in individuals exposed to famine in utero. We therefore investigated DNA methylation
    in a unique sample of patients and healthy individuals conceived during the great
    famine in China. Subsequently we examined two case-control samples without famine
    exposure in whole blood and brain tissue. To shed light on the causality of the
    relation between famine exposure and DNA methylation we exposed human fibroblasts
    to nutritional deprivation. In the famine exposed schizophrenia patients we found
    significant hypermethylation of the dual specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene
    promoter (Chr6:291687-293285) (N=153, p=0.01). In this sample DUSP22 methylation
    was also significantly higher in patients independent of famine exposure (p=0.025),
    suggesting that hypermethylation of DUSP22 is also more generally involved in
    schizophrenia risk. Similarly, DUSP22 methylation was also higher in two separate
    case-control sample not exposed to famine using DNA from whole blood (N=64, p=0.03)
    and postmortem brains (N=214, p=0.007). DUSP22 methylation showed strong genetic
    regulation across chromosomes by a region on chromosome 16 which was consistent
    with new 3D genome interaction data. The presence of a direct link between famine
    and DUSP22 transcription was supported by data from cultured human fibroblasts
    that showed increased methylation (p=0.048) and expression (p=0.019) in response
    to nutritional deprivation (N=10). These results highlight a first epigenetic
    locus that is genetically regulated across chromosomes and that is involved in
    the response to early life exposure to famine and that is relevant for a major
    psychiatric disorder.

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Although it is assumed that epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in\
    \ DNA methylation (DNAm), underlie the relationship between adverse intrauterine\
    \ conditions and adult metabolic health, evidence from human studies remains scarce.\
    \ Therefore, we evaluated whether DNAm in whole blood mediated the association\
    \ between prenatal famine exposure and metabolic health in 422 individuals exposed\
    \ to famine in utero and 463 (sibling) controls. We implemented a two-step analysis,\
    \ namely, a genome-wide exploration across 342,596 cytosine-phosphate-guanine\
    \ dinucleotides (CpGs) for potential mediators of the association between prenatal\
    \ famine exposure and adult body mass index (BMI), serum triglycerides (TG), or\
    \ glucose concentrations, which was followed by formal mediation analysis. DNAm\
    \ mediated the association of prenatal famine exposure with adult BMI and TG but\
    \ not with glucose. DNAm at PIM3 (cg09349128), a gene involved in energy metabolism,\
    \ mediated 13.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 5 to 28%] of the association between\
    \ famine exposure and BMI. DNAm at six CpGs, including TXNIP (cg19693031), influencing\
    \ \u03B2 cell function, and ABCG1 (cg07397296), affecting lipid metabolism, together\
    \ mediated 80% (95% CI, 38.5 to 100%) of the association between famine exposure\
    \ and TG. Analyses restricted to those exposed to famine during early gestation\
    \ identified additional CpGs mediating the relationship with TG near PFKFB3 (glycolysis)\
    \ and METTL8 (adipogenesis). DNAm at the CpGs involved was associated with gene\
    \ expression in an external data set and correlated with DNAm levels in fat depots\
    \ in additional postmortem data. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that\
    \ epigenetic mechanisms mediate the influence of transient adverse environmental\
    \ factors in early life on long-term metabolic health. The specific mechanism\
    \ awaits elucidation."

  path: no path

  summary: Cellular heterogeneity may bias cell type specific epigenetic patterns
    leading to a dramatic increase in false positive or negative findings in psychiatric
    epigenetic studies. To address this issue, we performed fluorescence activated
    cell sorting (FACS) of neuronal nuclei in post mortem frontal cortex 58 samples
    followed by Illumina HM450 microarray based DNA methylation profiling. We characterized
    the extent of neuron and glia specific DNA methylation variation independent of
    disease status and identified significant cell type specific epigenetic variation
    at 51% of loci.

  title: The PedBE clock estimates DNA methylation age in pediatric buccal cells [APrON]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: The development of current biological markers of aging has primarily focused
    on adult samples. The epigenetic clock is one promising tool for measuring biological
    age that shows impressive accuracy across most tissues and age ranges. In adults,
    deviations from the DNA methylation (DNAm) age prediction are correlated with
    several agerelated phenotypes, such as mortality and frailty. In children, however,
    fewer such associations have been made, possibly because DNAm changes are more
    dynamic in pediatric populations as  compared to adults. To address this crucial
    gap, we aimed to develop a highly accurate, noninvasive biological measure age
    specific to pediatric samples by using buccal epithelial cell DNAm. We gathered
    1,721 genome-wide DNAm profiles from 11 different cohorts of typically developing
    individuals aged 0 to 20 y old. Elastic net penalized regression was used to select
    94 CpG sites from a training dataset (n = 1,032) and the performance was assessed
    in a separate dataset (n = 689). The DNAm at 94 CpG sites was highly predictive
    of age in the test cohorts (median absolute error = 0.35 y). The Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic
    (PedBE) clock was characterized in additional cohorts, showcasing the accuracy
    in longitudinal data, the performance in nonbuccal tissues and adult age ranges,
    and the association with obstetric outcomes. The PedBE tool for measuring biological
    age in children might help in understanding the environmental and contextual factors
    that shape the DNA methylome during child development, and how it, in turn, might
    relate to child health and disease.

    has increased in early stage breast cancer (BC), and the late effects of cancer
    treatment can persist for decades.  The molecular mechanisms underlying acceleration
    of age-related diseases after chemotherapy and radiotherapy are poorly understood.  We
    examined epigenetic changes in peripheral blood in early stage BC patients undergoing
    either adjuvant radiotherapy, or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  DNA
    methylation experiments were performed on peripheral blood samples from women
    collected prior to and following completion of adjuvant therapy.  Methylation
    profiles were used to estimate three measures of epigenetic age acceleration -
    intrinsic, extrinsic, and phenotypic - as well as estimated cell counts.

  summary: "In Graves\u2019 disease (GD), a combination of genetic, epigenetic and\

    \ and enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks in sorted CD4+ and CD8+\
    \ T cells. We found 365 and 3322 differentially methylated CpG sites in CD4+ and\

  title: Integrated DNA methylation and RNA expression in Small Intestinal neuroendocrine
    tumors
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Background and Aims Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SINETs) are
    the commonest malignancy of the small intestine; however underlying pathogenic
    mechanisms remain poorly characterised. Whole genome and exome sequencing has
    demonstrated that SINETs are mutationally quiet with the most frequent known mutation
    in the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B gene (CDKN1B) occurring in only ~8%
    of tumours, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may drive tumourigenesis. The
    aim of this study is to perform genome-wide molecular profiling of SINETs in order
    to identify pathogenic drivers based on molecular profiling. This study represents
    the largest unbiased integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis
    undertaken in this tumour type. Methods Here we present data from integrated molecular
    analysis of SINETs (n=97) including whole exome or targeted CDKN1B sequencing
    (n=29), HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) array profiling (n=69), methylated
    DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (n=16), copy number variance analysis (n=47)
    and Whole Genome-DASL (Illumina) expression array profiling (n=43). Results Based
    on molecular profiling SINETs can be classified in to three groups which demonstrate
    significantly different progression-free survival after resection of primary tumour
    (not reached at 10 years vs 56 months vs 21 months, p=0.04). Epimutations were
    found at a recurrence rate of up to 85% and 21 epigenetically dysregulated genes
    were identified, including CDX1 (86%), CELSR3 (84%), FBP1 (84%) and GIPR (74%).
    Conclusions This is the first comprehensive integrated molecular analysis of SINETs.
    We have demonstrated that these tumours are highly epigenetically dysregulated.
    Furthermore, we have identified novel molecular subtypes with significant impact

  title: The methylome of DDR genes and benefit from RT or TMZ in IDH mutant low grade
    glioma treated in EORTC 22033
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Treatment modalities for patients with low grade glioma (LGG) WHO grade
    II are controversial. Overall survival ranges from 2 to over 15 years depending
    on molecular and clinical factors. Hence, risk adjusted treatments are required
    to preserve cognitive function and quality of life. We aim at identifying mechanisms
    and associated molecular markers predicting benefit from radiotherapy (RT) or
    temozolomide (TMZ) on progression free survival in 120 isocitrate dehydrogenase
    1 or 2 (IDHmt) mutant LGG treated in the randomized phase III trial EORTC 22033.
    IDH mutations, the characteristic hallmark of LGG, are associated with a CpG island
    methylator phenotype (CIMP). Given the genotoxic treatments in this study we determined
    the DNA methylome of DNA damage response (DDR) genes and assessed the association
    with progression free survival (PFS). We identified 62 functional CpGs corresponding
    to 24 of 410 DDR genes in the multidimensional LGG dataset from The Cancer Genome
    Atlas. Despite the low-powered study, the simulations suggested that seven CpGs,
    associated with 4 genes could be predictive for PFS in EORTC 22033. Most interestingly,
    two of the CpGs correspond to MGMT and consisted of the 2 probes used in the MGMT-STP27
    classifier. The extent of methylation was predictive for PFS in the TMZ, but not
    the RT arm. LGG IDHmt and 1p and 19q codeleted that overlap largely with oligodendroglioma
    displayed a higher extent of MGMT methylation than the IDHmt non-codeleted tumors
    based on several independent LGG datasets. This is consistent with a better PFS
    of codeleted patients in the TMZ arm as compared to the non-codeleted patients,
    while no difference was observed in the RT-arm.

  title: DNA extracted from saliva for methylation studies of psychiatric traits
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation has become increasingly recognized in the etiology of psychiatric
    disorders. Because brain tissue is not accessible in living humans, epigenetic
    studies are most often conducted in blood. Saliva is often collected for genotyping
    studies but is rarely used to examine DNA methylation because the proportion of
    epithelial cells and leukocytes varies extensively between individuals.  The goal
    of this study was to evaluate whether saliva DNA is informative for studies of
    psychiatric disorders.   Saliva and blood methylation was clearly distinguishable
    though there was positive correlation overall. There was little correlation in
    CpG sites within relevant candidate genes.  Correlated CpG sites were more likely
    to occur in areas of low CpG density (i.e. CpG shores and open seas). There was
    more variability in CpG sites from saliva than blood, which may reflect its heterogeneity.
    Thus, this study provides a framework for using DNA methylation from saliva and
    suggests that DNA methylation of saliva may offer distinct opportunities for epidemiological
    and longitudinal studies of psychiatric traits.

  title: Genome-wide methylation analysis detects genes specific to breast cancer
    hormone receptor status and risk of recurrence
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: To better understand the biology of hormone receptor-positive and negative
    breast cancer and to identify methylated gene markers of disease progression,
    we performed a genome-wide methylation array analysis on 103 primary invasive
    breast cancers and 21 normal breast samples using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27
    array that queried 27,578 CpG loci. Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive
    tumors displayed more hypermethylated loci than ER-negative tumors. However, the
    hypermethylated loci in ER-negative tumors were clustered closer to the transcriptional
    start site compared to ER-positive tumors. An ER-classifier set of CpG loci was
    identified, which independently partitioned primary tumors into ER-subtypes. Forty
    (32 novel, 8 previously known) CpG loci showed differential methylation specific
    to either ER-positive or ER-negative tumors.  Each of the 40 ER-subtype-specific
    loci was validated in silico using an independent, publicly available methylome
    dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  In addition, we identified 100 methylated
    CpG loci that were significantly associated with disease progression; the majority
    of these loci were informative particularly in ER-negative breast cancer. Overall,
    the set was highly enriched in homeobox containing genes. This pilot study demonstrates
    the robustness of the breast cancer methylome and illustrates its potential to
    stratify and reveal biological differences between ER-subtypes of breast cancer.
    Further, it defines candidate ER-specific markers and identifies potential markers
    predictive of outcome within ER subgroups.

  title: "DNA methylation-based classification of sinonasal tumors\_[reference set]"
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: The histopathological diagnosis of sinonasal tumors is challenging as it
    encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of various differential diagnoses as well
    as poorly defined, disputed entities such as sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas
    (SNUCs). In this study, we show that a machine learning algorithm based on DNA
    methylation is able to classify sinonasal tumors with clinical-grade reliability.
    We further show that tumors with SNUC morphology are not as undifferentiated as
    their current terminology suggests, but can be assigned to four molecular classes
    defined by distinct epigenic, mutational and proteomic profiles. This includes
    two classes with neuroendocrine differentiation, characterized by IDH2 or SWI/SNF
    chromatin remodeling complex mutations and overall favorable clinical course,
    highly aggressive tumors that are driven by SMARCB1-deficiency and tumors that
    represent previously misclassified adenoid-cystic carcinomas. Our findings have
    the potential to dramatically improve the diagnostic of challenging sinonasal
    tumors and could fundamentally change the current perception of SNUCs.

    \ generally located in intergenic regions, non-CpG Islands, and enhancers. Of\
    \ the aDNAm\u2019s identified, 650 are known to be involved in cancer, including\

  title: Global Methylation Profiles in Buccal Cells of Long-Term Smokers and Moist
    Snuff Consumers
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Alternations in gene methylation and other epigenetic changes regulate
    normal development as well as drive disease progression. Chronic cigarette smoking
    causes hyper- and hypo-methylation of genes that could contribute to smoking-related
    diseases. It is unclear whether consumers of non-combustible tobacco, such as
    moist snuff, also exhibit such perturbations in their methylome. Here, we present
    global methylation changes relative to non-tobacco consumers in buccal cells collected
    from smokers (SMK) and moist snuff consumers (MSC). Generally healthy adult male
    study subjects were recruited into SMK, MSC and Non-Tobacco Consumer (NTC) cohorts
    (40 subjects/cohort). Global methylation profiling was performed on the Illumina
    450K methylation array using buccal cell DNA. A total of 1,252 loci were found
    to be significantly differentially methylated in tobacco consumers relative to
    non-tobacco consumers. Overall, the SMK cohort exhibited larger qualitative and
    quantitative changes relative to MSC. Approximately half of the total number of
    gene loci, classified as Combustible Tobacco-Related signatures, and a third of
    the changes, termed Tobacco-Related signatures, were commonly detected in the
    tobacco consumers. Very few differences were detected between MSC and NTC, and
    hierarchical clustering of the top 50 significant gene loci suggested that MSC
    and NTC co-cluster. Consistent with physiological functions of AhR, combustible
    tobacco drives profound changes in buccal cell methylation status, principally
    impacting cell development and immune response pathways. These results aid in
    placing combustible and non-combustible tobacco products along a risk continuum
    and provide additional insights into the effects of tobacco consumption.

  title: Associations with early life socio-economic position in adult DNA methylation
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Comparison of whole blood DNA methylation in 45 year-old humans with low
    and high childhood and adulthood socio-economic positionBackground: Disadvantaged
    socio-economic position (SEP) in childhood is associated with increased adult
    mortality and morbidity. We aimed to establish whether childhood SEP was associated
    with differential methylation of adult DNA.Methods: Forty adult males from the
    1958 British Birth Cohort Study were selected from SEP extremes in both early
    childhood and mid-adulthood. We performed genome-wide methylation analysis on
    blood DNA taken at 45y using MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation).  We mapped
    in triplicate the methylation state of promoters of ~20,000 genes and 400 microRNAs.
    Probe methylation scores were averaged across triplicates and differential methylation
    between groups of individuals was determined. Differentially methylated promoter
    sites of selected genes were validated using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted
    DNA.Results: 9,112 variably methylated probes (from N=223,359 on the microarray)
    corresponded to 6,176 gene promoters with at least one variable probe. Unsupervised
    hierarchical clustering of probes obtained from the 500 most variable promoters
    revealed a cluster enriched with high SEP individuals confirming that SEP differences
    contribute to overall epigenetic variation. Methylation levels for 1252 gene promoters
    were associated with childhood SEP vs 545 promoters for adulthood SEP. Functionally,
    associations with childhood SEP appear in promoters of genes enriched in key cell
    signalling pathways.  The differentially methylated promoters associated with
    SEP cluster in megabase-sized regions of the genome.Conclusions: Adult blood DNA
    methylation profiles show more associations with childhood SEP than adult SEP.
    Organization of these associations across the genome suggests a well-defined epigenetic
    pattern linked to early socio-economic environment.'

  title: Methylome and transcriptome profiling of giant cell arteritis monocytes reveals
    novel pathways involved in disease pathogenesis and molecular response to glucocorticoids
    [array]
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a complex systemic vasculitis mediated by
    the interplay between both genetic and epigenetic factors. Monocytes are crucial
    players of the inflammation occurring in GCA. Therefore, characterization of the
    monocyte methylome and transcriptome in GCA would be helpful to better understand
    disease pathogenesis. We performed an integrated epigenome- and transcriptome-wide
    association study in CD14+ monocytes from 82 patients with GCA, cross-sectionally
    classified into three different clinical status (active, in remission with or
    without glucocorticoid (GC)-treatment), and 31 healthy controls. We identified
    a global methylation and gene expression dysregulation in GCA monocytes. Specifically,
    monocytes from active patients showed a more pro-inflammatory phenotype compared
    with healthy controls and patients in remission. In addition to inflammatory pathways
    known to be involved in active GCA, such as response to interleukin (IL)-6 and
    IL-1, we identified a significant number of chemokines, such as CCRL2, and integrins.
    Furthermore, monocytes from patients in remission with treatment showed downregulation
    of genes involved in inflammatory processes as well as overexpression of GC receptor-target
    genes. Finally, we identified changes in DNA methylation correlating with alterations
    in expression levels of genes with a potential role in GCA pathogenesis, such
    as ITGA7 and CD63, as well as genes mediating the molecular response to GC, including
    FKBP5, ETS2, ZBTB16, and ADAMTS2. Our results revealed profound alterations in
    the methylation and transcriptomic profiles of monocytes from GCA patients, uncovering
    novel genes and pathways involved in GCA pathogenesis and in the molecular response
    to GC treatment.

  title: Quantifying the neuronal and glial composition of the brain using DNA methylation
    profiles
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: To date, most epigenetic datasets have been generated on DNA samples isolated
    from bulk tissues. As the proportion of individual cell types within a sample
    can vary across individuals, systematic differences in cellular proportions that
    correlate with the phenotype of interest may manifest as differences in the overall
    epigenetic profile. Deconvolution algorithms calculate a series of continuous
    variables reflecting the underlying cellular heterogeneity of each sample from
    the bulk tissue profile that can be used to adjust for confounding in epigenome-wide
    association analyses. Here we provide novel reference profiles for brain cell
    types for use with reference based deconvolution algorithms. We used a FANS protocol
    recently described by our group to purify nuclei populations from prefrontal cortex
    tissue from 43 adult donors. Our initial gating strategy used an antibody against
    NeuN  to isolate neuronal nuclei in combination with an antibody against SOX10
    to separate oligodendrocyte nuclei from other glial nuclei. Subsequently, in a
    second gating strategy we additionally included an antibody against IRF8 to enrich
    microglia from the NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg fraction. Our third gating strategy used an
    antibody against SATB2 in place of NeuN to isolate excitatory neurons. We generated
    DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina EPIC array for NeuNPos (neuron-enriched;
    n = 28), NeuNNeg/SOX10Pos (oligodendrocyte-enriched; n = 24), NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg
    (microglia- and astrocyte-enriched; n = 21), NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg/IRF8Pos (microglia-enriched;
    n = 17), NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg/IRF8Neg, (astrocyte-enriched; n = 7), SATB2Pos (excitatory
    neuron-enriched; n = 9), and SATB2Neg (inhibitory neuron- and glial- enriched;
    n = 6) nuclei populations. We have demonstrated that these are applicable for
    use with established deconvolution algorithms to quantify the cellular heterogeneity
    of the cortex and other regions of the human brain from bulk DNAm data. These
    variables will be critical covariates to include in future epigenetic studies
    of brain disorders to minimise the risk of false positive associations and improve
    our understanding of the changes in the brain that underpin the development of
    psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

  title: DNA methylation signatures in airway cells from adult children of asthmatic
    mothers reflect subtypes of severe asthma (DNA methylation)
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Maternal asthma (MA) is among the most consistent risk factors for asthma
    in her children. Possible mechanisms for this observation are epigenetic modifications
    in utero that have lasting effects on developmental programs in children of mothers
    with asthma. To test this hypothesis, we performed differential DNA methylation
    analyses of 398,186 individual CpG sites in primary bronchial epithelial cells
    (BECs) from 42 non-asthma controls and 88 asthma cases, including 56 without MA
    (NMA) and 32 with MA. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
    of 69 and 554 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) that were specific to NMA
    or MA cases, respectively, compared to controls. WGCNA grouped 66 NMA-DMCs and
    203 MA-DMCs into two and five co-methylation modules, respectively. The eigenvector
    of one MA-associated module (turquoise) was uniquely correlated with 85 genes
    expressed in BECs and enriched for 36 pathways, 16 of which discriminated between
    NMA and MA using machine learning. Genes in all 16 pathways were decreased in
    MA compared to NMA cases (P=7.1x10-3), a finding that replicated in nasal epithelial
    cells from an independent cohort (P=0.02). Functional interpretation of these
    pathways suggested impaired T cell signaling and responses to viral and bacterial
    pathogens. The MA-associated turquoise module eigenvector was additionally correlated
    with clinical features of severe asthma and reflective of type 2 (T2)-low asthma
    (i.e., low total serum IgE, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and eosinophilia).
    Overall, these data suggest that maternal asthma alters diverse epigenetically-mediated
    pathways that lead to distinct subtypes of severe asthma in adults including hard-to-treat
    T2-low asthma.

  title: "DNA Methylation subclass\_Receptor Tyrosine Kinase II (RTK II)\_is predictive\
    \ for seizure development in glioblastoma patients"
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: Seizures can present at any time before or after the diagnosis
    of a glioma. Roughly, 25-30 % of glioblastoma (GBM) patients initially present
    with seizures, and an additional 30 % develop seizures during the course of the
    disease. Early studies failed to show an effect of general administration of anti-epileptic
    drugs for glioblastoma patients, since they were unable to stratify patients into
    high- or low- risk seizure groups.  Methods: 112 patients, who underwent surgery
    for a GBM, were included. Genome- wide DNA methylation profiling was performed,
    before methylation subclasses and copy number changes inferred from methylation
    data were correlated with clinical characteristics. Independently, global gene
    expression was analyzed in GBM methylation subclasses from TCGA datasets (n=68).  Results:
    Receptor tyrosine Kinase (RTK) II GBM showed a significantly higher incidence
    of seizures than RTK I and mesenchymal (MES) GBM (p<0.01). Accordingly, RNA expression
    datasets revealed an upregulation of genes involved in neurotransmitter synapses
    and vesicle transport in RTK II glioblastomas. In a multivariate analysis, temporal
    location (p=0.01, OR 6.35) and RTK II (p=0.03, OR 5.56) were most predictive for
    preoperative seizures. During postoperative follow-up, only RTK II remained significantly
    associated with the development of seizures (p<0.01, OR 8.23). Consequently, the
    need for antiepileptic medication and its increase due to treatment failure was
    highly associated with the RTK II methylation subclass (p<0.01).  Conclusion:
    Our study shows a strong correlation of RTK II glioblastomas with preoperative
    and long-term seizures. These results underline the benefit of molecular glioblastoma
    profiling with important implications for postoperative seizure control.'

  title: Integrative genomic analyses in adipocytes implicate DNA methylation in human
    obesity and diabetes
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: DNA methylation variations are prevalent in human obesity but evidence
    of a causative role in disease pathogenesis is limited. Here, we combine epigenome-wide
    association and integrative genomics to investigate the impact of adipocyte DNA
    methylation variations in human obesity. We discover extensive DNA methylation
    changes that are robustly associated with obesity (N=190 samples, 691 loci in
    subcutaneous and 173 loci in visceral adipocytes, P<1x10-7). We connect obesity-associated
    methylation variations to transcriptomic changes at >500 target genes, and identify
    putative methylation-transcription factor interactions. Through Mendelian Randomisation,
    we infer causal effects of methylation on obesity and obesity-induced metabolic
    disturbances at 59 independent loci. Targeted methylation sequencing, CRISPR-activation
    and gene silencing in adipocytes, further identifies regional methylation variations,
    underlying regulatory elements and novel cellular metabolic effects. Our results
    indicate DNA methylation is an important determinant of human obesity and its
    metabolic complications, and reveal mechanisms through which altered methylation
    may impact adipocyte functions.

  title: Fourteen-weeks combined exercise epigenetically modulated 118 genes of menopausal
    women with prediabetes
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: Pre-diabetes condition precedes the Diabetes Mellitus (DM)\
    \ disease and is a critical period for hyperglycemia treatment, especially for\
    \ menopausal women, considering all metabolic alterations due to hormonal changes.\
    \ Recently, the literature has demonstrated the role of physical exercise in epigenetic\
    \ reprogramming to modulate the gene expression patterns of metabolic conditions,\
    \ such as hyperglycemia, preventing DM development. In the present study, we hypothesized\
    \ that physical exercise training could modify the epigenetic patterns of women\
    \ with poor glycemic control. Methods: 48 post-menopause women aged 60.3\xB14.5\
    \ years were divided according to the fasting blood glucose levels into two groups:\
    \ Prediabetes Group, PG (n=24) and Normal Glucose Group, NGG (n=24). All participants\
    \ performed 14 weeks of physical exercise three times a week. The Infinium Methylation\
    \ EPIC BeadChip measured the participants\u2019 Different Methylated Regions (DMRs).\
    \ Results: Before the intervention, the PG group had 12 DMRs compared to NGG.\
    \ After the intervention, five DMRs remained different. Interestingly, when comparing\
    \ the PG group before and after training, 118 DMRs were found. The enrichment\
    \ analysis revealed that the genes were related to different biological functions\
    \ such as energy metabolism, cell differentiation, and tumor suppression. Conclusion:\
    \ Physical exercise is a relevant alternative in treating hyperglycemia and preventing\
    \ DM in post-menopause women with poor glycemic control."

  summary: Undifferentiated arthritis (UA) is the term used to cover all the cases
    of arthritis that do not fit a specific diagnosis. A high proportion of UA patients
    can progress to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or a different definite rheumatic disease,
    while others undergo spontaneous remission. In this study, we performed DNA methylation

  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: "Background: The risk of developing Barrett\u2019s esophagus (BE) and/or\
    \ esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is associated with specific demographic and\
    \ behavioral factors, including gender, obesity/elevated body-mass index (BMI),\
    \ and tobacco use.  Alterations in DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification\
    \ that can affect gene expression and that can be influenced by environmental\
    \ factors, is frequently present in both BE and EAC and is believed to play a\
    \ role in the formation of BE and its progression to EAC. It is currently unknown\
    \ whether obesity or tobacco smoking influence the risk of developing BE/EAC via\
    \ the induction of alterations in DNA methylation.  To investigate this possibility,\
    \ we assessed the genome-wide methylation status of 81 esophageal tissues, including\
    \ BE, dysplastic BE, and EAC epithelia using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina).\
    \ Results: We found numerous differentially methylated loci in the esophagus tissues\
    \ when comparing males to females, obese to lean individuals, and smokers to nonsmokers.\
    \ Differences in DNA methylation between these groups were seen in a variety of\
    \ functional genomic regions, and both within and outside of CpG islands.  Several\
    \ cancer-related pathways were found to have differentially methylated genes between\
    \ these comparison groups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest obesity and tobacco\
    \ smoking may influence DNA methylation in the esophagus and raise the possibility\
    \ that these risk factors affect the development of BE, dysplastic BE, and EAC\
    \ through influencing the epigenetic status of specific loci that have a biologically\
    \ plausible role in cancer formation."

  title: CXCL4 links inflammation and fibrosis through transcriptional and epigenetic
    reprogramming of inflammatory monocyte-derived cells
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Fibrosis is a condition shared by numerous inflammatory diseases. The
    molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis have remained incompletely understood
    severely hampering drug development. CXCL4 is associated with the onset and extent
    of fibrosis development in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a prototypic inflammatory
    and fibrotic disease. Here, we integrated 65 paired sequential whole genome transcriptional
    and methylation profiles from monocyte-derived cells as they respond to CXCL4
    exposure. Using data-driven gene regulatory network analyses, we demonstrate that
    CXCL4 dramatically alters monocyte differentiation trajectory inducing a novel
    pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic phenotype mediated via key regulators such as
    CIITA and IRF8. Importantly, these CXCL4 exposed pro-inflammatory cells trigger
    a fibrosis cascade by directly producing ECM molecules and by inducing myofibroblast
    differentiation. Underscoring the computationally identified gene regulatory network,
    inhibition of CIITA mimicked CXCL4 inducing pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
    phenotype. Our study uncovers CXCL4 as the endogenous ligand driving innate immune
    training and forming the long-sought link between inflammation and fibrosis.This

  title: Genome-wide DNA Methylation Comparison between Live Human Brain and Peripheral
    Tissues within Individuals
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: Differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in the brain is associated with many
    psychiatric diseases, but access to brain tissues is essentially limited to post-mortem
    samples. The use of surrogate tissues has become common in identifying methylation
    changes associated with psychiatric disease. In this study, we determined the
    extent to which peripheral tissues can be used as surrogates for DNAm in the brain.
    Blood, saliva, buccal, and live brain tissue samples from 27 medically intractable
    epilepsy patients undergoing brain resection were collected. Genome-wide methylation
    was assessed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (n=12) and HumanMethylationEPIC
    BeadChip arrays (n=21). For each CpG and each gene, levels of brain-peripheral
    tissue correlation varied widely. This indicates that to determine the most useful
    surrogate tissue for representing brain DNAm, the patterns specific to the genomic
    region of interest must be considered. To assist in that objective, we have developed
    a website, IMAGE-CpG, that allows researchers to interrogate DNAm levels and degree
    of cross-tissue correlation in user-defined locations across the genome.

  title: Adult intracranial ependymoma - relevance of DNA methylation profiling for
    diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
  path: no path
  organism: Homo sapiens
  summary: 'Background: A methylation-based classification of ependymoma has recently
    found broad application. However, the diagnostic advantage and implications for
    treatment decisions remain unclear. Here, we retrospectively evaluate the impact
    of surgery and radiotherapy on outcome after molecular reclassification of adult
    intracranial ependymomas.  Methods: Tumors diagnosed as intracranial ependymomas
    from 170 adult patients collected from eight diagnostic institutions were subjected
    to DNA methylation profiling. Molecular classes, patient characteristics, and
    treatment were retrospectively correlated with progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:
    The classifier indicated an ependymal tumor in 73.5%, a different tumor entity
    in 10.6% and non-classifiable tumors in 15.9% of cases, respectively. The most
    prevalent molecular classes were posterior fossa ependymoma group B (EPN-PFB,
    32.9%), posterior fossa subependymoma (PF-SE, 25.9%), and supratentorial ZFTA
    fusion-positive ependymoma (EPN-ZFTA, 11.2%). With a median follow-up of 60.0
    months, the 5- and 10-year-PFS rates were 64.5% and 41.8% for EPN-PFB, 67.4% and
    45.2% for PF-SE and 60.3% and 60.3% for EPN-ZFTA. In EPN-PFB, but not in other
    molecular classes, gross total resection (p=0.009) and postoperative radiotherapy
    (p=0.007) were significantly associated with improved PFS in multivariable analysis.
    Histological tumor grading (WHO 2 vs. 3) was not a predictor of prognosis within
    molecularly defined ependymoma classes.   Conclusions: DNA methylation profiling
    improves diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification in adult intracranial ependymoma.
    The molecular class of PF-SE is unexpectedly prevalent among adult tumors with
    ependymoma histology and relapsed as frequently as EPN-PFB, despite the supposed
    benign nature. Gross total resection and radiotherapy may represent key factors
    in determining the outcome of EPN-PFB patients.'
